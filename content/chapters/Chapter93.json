He entered the same town after a brief period of eight years at the head of ten thousand devoted followers. At Badr there were only 313 Muslims with him and at Uhud more than double that number, and in the Battle of the Ditch the number grew to several thousand, till at the last Pilgrimage more than one hundred thousand believers marched under his banner. The successes of the Holy Prophet continued after his death. Islam went from strength to strength till it spread, within a few decades, over a large part of the then known world.</p><p>The reference in the verse may also be to the latter days when the renaissance of Islam was to take place.

                    "note": "<p><strong>Important Words:</strong></p><p>ضال (wandering) is derived from ضل which means, he erred or went astray; he was perplexed and was unable to see the right course; he was entirely engrossed or was lost in the love of a thing; he wandered in search of a thing and persevered in the search. ضل الماء فی اللبن means, the water became hidden in the milk, etc. (Lane, Aqrab &amp; Mufradat).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>In view of different meanings of the word ضل given above under Important Words, the verse may be interpreted thus: (1) The Holy Prophet wandered in search of the ways and means to attain to God, and God revealed to him the law which guided him to the desired goal. (2) He was perplexed and did not know how to find the path that led to the attainment of his quest and God guided him to it (42:53). (3) He was entirely lost in the love of God and did not know how to find Him but God led him to Himself (12:9). (4) He was hidden from the eyes of the world. God discovered him and chose him for the task of leading people to Him. Thus the word ضال has not been used in disapprobation but in praise of the Holy Prophet. The word in the sense of 'gone astray' does not and cannot apply to the Holy Prophet since according to another Quranic verse (53:3) he was immune to error or going astray. Moreover, the six concluding verses of the <i>Surah</i> reveal a certain sequence—vv. 7, 8 &amp; 9 standing in close relationship and corresponding to vv. 10, 11 &amp; 12 respectively; the ضال of verse 8 being substituted by سائل of verse 11, explains the significance of the former word which is, \"one who sought God’s help to be guided to Him.\"</p><p>The verse may also be interpreted as: And He found thee lost in thy love for thy people, and provided thee with guidance for them.</p>"
