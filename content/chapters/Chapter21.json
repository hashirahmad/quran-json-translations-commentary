The verse may also be considered as pointing to the spread of Islam in Medina where the foundations had been laid for the future greatness and glory of Islam. It seems strange that the so-called learned western writers should have blundered into assigning to the revelation of this <i>Surah</i> a date which was very close to the time of the Hijrah and the spread of Islam in Medina and thus should have unwittingly provided evidence that the Quran is a Divine Book which contains prophecies according to which a small and weak community within the space of a few years came to occupy a predominant position in a vast country like Arabia, and Mecca which from time immemorial had refused to submit to any conqueror fell to Muslim arms.</p><p>The word اقترب signifies that the early signs of the impending Divine punishment have already begun to appear and yet disbelievers give no heed to this grim fact.

See also 19:11.</p><p>اضغاث احلام (confused dreams). See 12:45.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>In this verse three different objections of disbelievers with regard to the Quran have been mentioned. The first is that the Quran is a mixture of confused dreams. But realizing the untenability of their position, as there exists a beautiful arrangement and order in it and that it forms a connected whole and contains excellent teachings, the disbelievers shift their ground and say that the Holy Prophet has forged it himself. But again realizing that throughout his life the Prophet was by common consent known and looked upon as \"the trusty\" and \"the truthful,\" they give up this objection also and proceed to accuse him of being a poet and a magician. These objections have been mentioned in an ascending order and the continuous shifting of the ground by disbelievers implies an admission on their part that their objections can stand no examination or scrutiny. The Quran has therefore refused to entertain them here because they carry their own refutation and are self-contradictory and foolish. Further on, however, it has answered these objections in another context.</p><p>The demand, <i>let him then bring us a Sign just as the former Prophets were sent with Signs</i>, is clearly foolish and insolent. There has never appeared a Prophet in the world who was not confronted with a similar demand. Jesus was so infuriated with the Scribes and the Pharisees when they said: \"Master, we should see a sign from thee\" (Matt. 12:38), that he exclaimed in extreme anger: \"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonas\" (Matt. 12:39). The refusal on the part of the Quran to entertain the disbelievers’ demand in the manner they expected it, does not imply that no sign had been or was to be shown to them. It only means to demonstrate that the demand is foolish and insolent and that heavenly Signs differ from age to age and therefore the signs that would be shown by the Holy Prophet would be different from those that were shown by Moses or Jesus and for that matter by any other Prophet.</p><p>The word شاعر (poet) while meaning one who composes verses also signifies a person who plays with the sentiments and susceptibilities of men. Here the word has been used preferably in the latter sense.</p>"

The truth of this fact has been demonstrated throughout the ages in the time of every Prophet of God. The verse purports to say that if what the Holy Prophet claims to have received from God are mere confused dreams and not Divine revelations and if he is an impostor and a liar then how could the great prophecies about the triumph of his cause and the failure of his opponents made at a time when there appeared no likelihood of their being fulfilled, come to be true? Moreover, as a poet the Prophet could only compose elegant verse or could play with the emotions of men as poets generally do, but he could not bring about a wonderful change in the lives of his followers as he did and could not see into the future and make prophecies which in the teeth of the opposition of his powerful enemies and in spite of his own utter helplessness were fulfilled to the very letter.

If there had been more than one God, then more than one law would have governed the universe because for a god it is necessary to create a universe with its own laws; and thus disorder and confusion would have been the inevitable result and the whole universe would have gone to pieces. Moreover, the very word اله (meaning a Being Who is the object of our utmost love, obedience and submission and Who possesses perfect powers and attributes) shows that such a Perfect Being can only be one at one time. It is manifestly absurd to say that three gods, equally perfect in all respects, are jointly the creators and controllers of the universe. The fact of the three gods doing, and should do, the same thing which One Perfect God can implies their imperfection and an imperfect being cannot be our اله (One Who is worthy of our adoration).</p>"

It purports to say that all the Divine Messengers and great religious reformers who appeared among different nations and countries at different times testified with one voice to the Oneness of God which was their common mission. In spite of the fact that with the passage of time the teachings of these Prophets became tampered with and were subjected to distortions and interpolations, the belief in the Unity of God continued to be the basic principle of all these teachings. These Prophets and Messengers appeared among all nations and peoples and the greatest of all, the Holy Prophet Muhammad, appeared at a time when the whole world was immersed in the Cimmerian darkness of moral turpitude, and idol worship was rife among every people and country in one form or another and was practised in its most heinous form in Arabia where the Holy Prophet preached his message of the Oneness of God. He carried on such an effective and relentless campaign against idolatry that it disappeared from Arabia never to return. Not only did he condemn and forbid idol-worship and enjoin and impress upon his people the worship of One True God but also gave unanswerable arguments in support of monotheism and against polytheism and he fully succeeded in engendering in the minds of his followers an invincible faith in Divine Unity and an equally implacable hatred for <i>shirk</i>—setting up equals with God. In four short sentences of one of its shortest <i>Surah</i>—Al-Ikhlas, the Quran has refuted and demolished in a most beautiful and effective manner four forms of polytheism. The first verse proclaims the absolute Unity of God. It says: \"Say, He is Allah, the One.\" It means that out of ignorance and perversity man invents and indulges in most fantastic theories and ideas about God. But the central and pivotal fact about the Divine Being remains that He is absolutely One in every respect and manner. He is neither the beginning nor the end of anything and He is not like anything, nor any thing is like Him. To regard anything like Him is to impugn His absolute Unity.</p><p>In the words, \"Allah, the Independent and Besought of all,\" the Quran has demolished the second kind of <i>shirk</i> i.e. to ascribe Divine powers and attributes to other beings and things. The verse says that God has need of nobody but all beings and things have need of Him. It is therefore foolish and futile to have recourse to beings and things which themselves are wholly dependent upon God. The third verse, viz. \"He begets not, nor is He begotten\" refutes and repudiates the third kind of polytheism i.e. the doctrine of God being the father or son of anybody. The verse means to say that God is eternal and everlasting. He has begotten no son who should take His place, nor is He begotten of anyone from whom He should have inherited His Divine powers and attributes. He was always Independent and Besought of all and will ever be so. So we should worship Him and call on Him alone for the fulfilment of our needs and requirements. The verse \"And there is none like unto Him,\" exposes the folly and futility of the fourth kind of <i>shirk</i>. It signifies that it is beyond any created thing to be His partner in Divinity i.e. to be like Him in His person or attributes. God is far exalted and above that to which man can aspire. However high man may rise, he cannot even touch the fringes of the precincts of Divinity and will ever remain God’s servant.</p><p>This is the most sublime conception of absolute Unity of God as taught and inculcated by the Quran.</p><p>At another place (2:256) the Quran has shed further light on Divine Unity. It says: \"There is no God but Allah, the Living, the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining. Slumber seizes Him not, nor sleep (i.e. no interruption ever takes place in His works). To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission (i.e. God grants the prayers of His servants but no one should think that He can compel God to accept His prayer. It is after He has granted the permission to any of His servants that he can intercede with Him)? He knows what is before them and what is behind them (i.e. He knows the past and the future. His knowledge is complete and all-comprehensive because full control is not possible without complete knowledge and complete knowledge is the never-failing accompaniment of absolute Unity). And they encompass nothing of His knowledge except what He pleases (i.e. man can accomplish nothing except with the help of the knowledge that he receives from God). His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth (i.e. not an atom moves in the heavens and the earth without His permission and every particle is subject to His control). And the care of them burdens Him not (i.e. the universe will continue to exist and function under the never-failing supervision and protection of God). And He is the High (i.e. every atom of the universe bears witness to His Almightiness and He is so exalted that human reason cannot attain to full comprehension of Him); and yet He is great (i.e. He is so manifest in His great works that every honest seeker after Him can attain to communion with Him).\" This is the very high and noble conception of Divine Unity which the Holy Prophet gave to the world and for which he worked and suffered. He told the people of the world that Divine Unity consists in the fact that man should rise to such a high stage of spiritual exaltation as to become completely engrossed in One God and become at one with Him. It is when man reaches this high stage of moral and spiritual development that he can be said to have attained the great object of his creation.</p>"

                    "note": "<p><strong>Important Words:</strong></p><p>رتقا (a closed-up mass) is inf. noun from رتق (<i>rataqa</i>). They say رتق الثوب i.e. he repaired or sewed up the cloth. رتق الشیء means, he repaired or closed up the thing. رتق is the contrary of فتق. The expression فتق المسک means, he took out the musk from the bladder of deer.فتق الثواب means, he slit, rent or opened up the cloth. They say رتق فتقھم i.e. he closed up the breach that was between them; he reconciled them. The Arabs say: ھو الراتق والفاتق i.e. he is the reformer of the affair. The word رتقhere means, ذواتی رتق i.e. things closed up, or better a closed-up mass, and فتق refers to the splitting of the amorphous mass or to the throwing off of the planets of the solar system.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The verse, by pointing to a great scientific truth, draws attention to a spiritual phenomenon of equally great importance. It refers to the pre-material stage of the universe and purports to say that the heavens and the earth or the whole universe or particularly the solar system has developed out of an amorphous or nebular mass. God, in accordance with the laws which He had set in motion, split the mass of matter, and its scattered bits became the units of the solar system (\"The Universe Surveyed\" by Harold Richards, and \"The Nature of the Universe\" by Fred Hoyle). God then created all life out of water. The verse seems to imply that like the material universe a spiritual universe also develops out of an amorphous mass of confused ideas and foolish beliefs. Just as God in His infallible wisdom and in pursuance of a great design split the mass of matter and its scattered bits became the units of the solar system, in the same way He brings about a new spiritual order in a world weltering in the morass of confused ideas. When mankind sinks into an impenetrable gloom of moral turpitude and spiritual atmosphere becomes dense and oppressive, God causes a light to appear in the form of a Heavenly Messenger who shakes up the overspreading spiritual gloom, and out of this confused and lifeless mass of moral depravity and spiritual degeneration a spiritual universe is born which begins to reach out from its centre and eventually embraces the whole earth, receiving life and direction from the impetus behind it. Just as all physical life is created from water, so does spiritual universe receive life from heavenly water which is Divine revelation. See also General Introduction.</p><p>The words \"the heavens and the earth were a closed-up mass,\" in a physical sense may signify that there is no rain from heaven, and the earth becomes parched and dried up and grows no vegetation, and life tends to become extinct. Spiritually speaking they may mean that there is a cessation of Divine revelation and the hearts and brains of men become corrupt and spiritual darkness enshrouds the entire face of the earth. Thus the whole verse may refer both to the general physical phenomenon and to the cessation of Divine revelation. The words \"then We opened them out,\" may refer to the throwing off of the planets of the solar system. Physically speaking they would mean that God sends down rain from heaven, and spiritually speaking they may signify that Divine revelation descends i.e. a Prophet is raised to whom God reveals Himself and to whom He vouchsafes His Word.</p><p>Again spiritually speaking the words \"And We made from water everything living\" signify that when the period of the cessation of revelation which has been called فترة in the Quran (5:20) ends, God sends a Messenger, who by means of Divine revelation, brings about complete moral revolution among his people and gives, as it were, new life to a spiritually dead people. Alluding to the physical phenomenon the words would mean that when on account of a long period of drought the earth becomes parched and dry, God sends down fresh rain from heaven and the earth begins to bloom and blossom and vibrate with a new life. Thus briefly the verse signifies that as no physical life can exist without water, similarly no spiritual life is possible without the water of Divine revelation.</p>"

The expression ان تمید بھم means, lest it should quake with them, be convulsed with them and go round with them and move about violently (Lane &amp; Aqrab). See also 16:16.</p><p>فجاجاً (wide pathways) is the plural of فج which is noun-infinitive from فج (<i>fajja</i>) which means, he opened or separated his two legs while walking. فجت الناقة means, the she-camel opened out her hinder legs for being milked. فج means, a wide and open pathway between two mountains (Aqrab).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The verse throws light on yet another scientific truth. Geology has established the fact that mountains have, to a great extent, secured the earth against earthquakes. Earth-quakes were very common before mountains were created. In the beginning the earth was very hot from inside. When as the result of the intense heat gases were formed in the bowels of the earth, they tried to force a way out, thus causing violent agitations and eruptions in the form of volcanoes which having cooled down took the shape of mountains. (\"Marvels and Mysteries of Science\" by Allison Hox &amp; Enc. Brit. under \"Geology\"). To this great scientific truth the words ان تمید بھم (lest it should quake with them) refer. Spiritually speaking the heat of sin and iniquity in the world throws out lava from its volcanoes and brings about moral destruction and then God cools down this fire by the spiritual water of Divine revelation and by means of \"mountains\" which spiritually speaking are Prophets and Divine Reformers.</p><p>Taking these words in the sense 'that it may go round with them,' the verse would signify that the mountains are a great help to the earth in moving steadily on its axis. The Quran spoke of the earth as \"moving round\" long before it was discovered that it was not stationary and moved on its axis and round the sun.</p><p>Again mountains, rivers and natural highways are among great Divine blessings. The mountains are natural reservoirs of water and vegetable and mineral wealth; the rivers constitute natural conduits for water, and natural highways make it possible for man to have access to these vast stores of Divine blessings. Spiritually speaking, 'mountains' are the Divine Prophets who are the great reservoirs of heavenly water and divine knowledge and 'highways' (which in the earth are the channels of rivers) represent righteous ulema (learned men) and divines who receive guidance from the prophets and convey it to common men. Just as rivers and streams become dried up when it does not rain on mountains, similarly pious and righteous men disappear from the world when no fresh revelation descends from heaven for a long time. Indeed revelation is as essential for spiritual life as is water for physical life.</p>"

They say سبح الرجل i.e. the man slept and took rest; he went far off in his walk. سبح فی الکلام means, he talked much. سبح فی الماء means, he glided along in the water and took great delight in it. The word is used metaphorically with regard to the floating or gliding of the stars and about the swift and smooth running of the horse (Aqrab).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>Spiritually speaking the sun stands for the Law-bearing Prophets, particularly the Holy Prophet of Islam, and the moon for those Reformers and Prophets who borrow their spiritual light from the Law-bearing Prophets. 'The day' represents the time when a new Prophet makes his appearance in the world and fresh revelation comes down from heaven and 'the night' represents that period when there is spiritual darkness all round and no revelation comes from God.</p><p>The verse means to say that the night and the day, the sun and the moon have all been created by God and serve a definite purpose. They all fulfil human needs and are indispensable for man’s existence on earth. The significance of the present and the preceding verse is that when God has taken so much care to provide for the physical and material needs of man, it is impossible even to think that He should have neglected to make a similar provision for his spiritual needs.</p>"

The words \"but ask me not to hasten,\" support this meaning. At another place in the Quran, we have خلقکم من ضعف (30:55) which also means that man by nature is very weak. Similarly, the verse خلقتنی من نار و خلقته من طین means, that Satan by nature is a fire-eater and man is by nature submissive (7:13). When the Arabs have to express a prominent natural characteristic of a person they say خلق منه i.e. he has been created of it. An Arab would say خلقت من لعب i.e. thou hast been created of sport i.e. \"you love and indulge very much in sport\" (Lisan).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The verse means to say that disbelievers treat the Holy Prophet with contempt because of the delay that has occurred in the Divine punishment overtaking them. They are warned that this delay should not mislead them into believing that they will go scot-free and that they should not reject the Message of Islam in haste and that the time was fast approaching when the prophecies made by the Prophet about the triumph and victory of Islam will be fulfilled and the punishment of God will descend on them swift and hard.</p>"

Abu Sufyan, the Quraishite chief, when asked by the Holy Prophet on the day of the Fall of Mecca whether he had not yet realized that there was no god but the One Almighty God, replied, \"Had there been any other gods beside God, verily they had been of some avail to us\" (Muir’s The Life of Mahomet, 1923 edition, p. 404).</p>"

It is this that when the time of the national prosperity of a people becomes prolonged, they come to labour under the misconception that their prosperity and progress will never see decline or decay and consequently they become arrogant and their hearts are hardened and they reject the message of their Prophet. Thus prolongation of the period of the prosperity of a people becomes the cause of their downfall. The verse warns disbelievers against wishful thinking and false complacency that their progress and prosperity will continue indefinitely and tells them not to shut their eyes to the patent fact that God is gradually but surely reducing and curtailing the land from all its sides i.e. Islam is making inroads into every home and all sections and strata of their society. The high and the low, the rich and the poor, the learned and the illiterate are daily joining its fold. It asks: \"Does not this fact alone constitute an irrefutable proof of the truth of Islam? And in view of the sure signs of their decline and fall do they still entertain the false hope that they will continue to enjoy peace, prosperity and progress and will be able to arrest or retard the progress of Islam?\" See also 13:42.</p>"

See also 6:93.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>In view of the different meanings of the root word برك the word مبارك possesses the sense of firmness, steadiness, continuity, abundance of good, exaltation and collection, etc. It is an epithet exclusively enjoyed by the Quran (6:93). No other Divine Scripture has been given this title. Even in other titles which the Quran possesses in common with other Divine Scriptures it exceeds them in degree, but <i>Mubarak</i> is its exclusive title and in this title lies its outstanding distinction. Being <i>Mubarak</i>, the Quran combines in itself all kinds of excellences. It is full of blessings which will continue to be bestowed upon its followers and which never decrease or diminish. There is no good which it does not possess in abundance and in which it does not excel other Holy Scriptures. Mankind will continue to benefit from its teaching till the end of time. This is not the case with other Scriptures. They are defunct. All life has departed from them. The very languages in which they were revealed are dead. But the Quran is a living Book. It shall live so long as mankind lasts and will continue to give light to a world groping in darkness.</p>"

Abraham too had his peculiar way of talking. While talking to idol-worshippers he generally made use of irony. In the present verse he appears to be asking a question while in reality he is speaking contemptuously of the gods of his people. This special style of Abraham is also apparent from 6:77,78,79. In the present verse he seems to say to his people: \"How useless and futile these images are which you worship!\" While Abraham used to talk in ironical language, Jesus would talk in metaphors. Several of his sayings quoted in the Quran have been misunderstood because they have been taken literally.</p><p>In the expression لـھا (lit. to which) the letter ل is used to denote respect and reverence and also to express emphasis. The word عکف is not generally followed by ل. We say عکف فی المکان i.e. he stayed in the place. عکف علی الامر means, he stuck to the affair (Aqrab).</p><p>The word اب beside meaning 'father' also means paternal uncle. The person mentioned in the above verse was Abraham’s uncle and not his father who is said to have died before Abraham was invested with the divine mission of a Prophet. See also 6:75.</p><p>The verse points to a very close resemblance between Abraham and the Holy Prophet. The fathers of both had died before they were made Prophets. Both were brought up by their uncles. Both preached the message of Unity of God to their uncles. Both the uncles refused to accept the Divine Message with this difference that whereas Abraham’s uncle opposed and persecuted him, Abu Talib, the Holy Prophet’suncle, though he did not accept his message, stood by him through thick and thin to the last moment of his life and even suffered for him.</p>"

They do not merely make an assertion about God but substantiate it with practical proofs from their own life. They do not invite people to God merely because human reason demands belief in His existence but they do it with full conviction and firm faith. When they say that God exists they say it with full conviction because they constantly hear His sweet voice and because also they themselves speak to Him and receive answer to their prayers from Him. God reveals Himself to them and they witness practical proofs of His power and omniscience in their own persons. So their testimony about the existence of God is based not on hearsay, nor on reason alone but primarily and principally on their personal experience. It is for this reason that God has commanded the Holy Prophet to declare:</p><p>\"I call unto Allah on sure knowledge, I and those who follow me\" (12:109).</p>"

Sometimes it is also used to denote the passing from one subject to another without cancelling what precedes it and is syn. with و(and), as in بل ھو قرآن مجید i.e. And it is a glorious Quran. Thus بل means, but; and; surely or verily (Lane). Here it is used in the sense of إن (surely).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>If the expression بل فعله کبیرھم ھذا is rendered as \"somebody has surely done this,\" a stop will have to be placed after فعله and the words کبیرھم ھذا will be treated as an independent sentence meaning, \"here is the chief\" of them. This is the meaning we have adopted in the text and this seems to be the more correct meaning. Or the words بل فعله کبیرھم ھذا may have been spoken ironically or by way of mockery by Abraham as was his wont while talking to his idolatrous people. In that case the sense of the words would be something like this: \"Why should have I done this, their chief here may have done it,\" meaning thereby that \"the fact is too evident to warrant any questioning or to need any explanation that I have done this, i.e. I have broken the idols. If I had not done this, could this lifeless block of stone have done this?\" In this verse Abraham seems to have rebuked his people for their idolatrous practices and brought home to them the futility of those practices, first by breaking the idols and then by challenging their votaries to ask those idols to tell them who had broken them.</p><p>The verse by implication points to one of the most important Divine attributes. Abraham confounded his idolatrous people by first breaking the idols and then by inferring therefrom that an idol which could not save itself from harm and which could not even answer the call of its worshippers was but a lifeless thing, fit to be thrown on the scrap-heap, and that his Lord was the Ever-living God Who answered and accepted the prayers of His servants. See also 20:90.</p>"

Divine teachers are now raised from among the followers of the Holy Prophet in every century to regenerate Islam and they will continue to do so till the end of time.

It may be said in passing that Prophet Noah was the first Law-bearing Prophet. The Holy Prophet is reported to have said about himاول نبی شرعت علی لسانه الشرائعi.e. he was the first Prophet to whom the Law was revealed. The Law first began to be revealed to Noah because in his time human mind had attained to such a stage of development as to have been able to understand and comprehend Divine attributes, and the evils which are the inevitable result of a civilized society had also begun to make their appearance in his time.</p>"

The reference is to the policy which David and Solomon adopted to repel and defeat the depredations of these savage tribes. David was a great warrior and as such was in favour of adopting a strong policy. Solomon, however, wished to pursue a milder policy and to win over these tribes by entering into treaties of friendship with them. Taken literally the verse would signify that even very ordinary people had ready access and could submit their cases to these great Prophets of God who were very powerful rulers. See also 6:85; 34:11-14 &amp; 38:18-21.</p><p>The verse may also signify that when a nation rises to power and prosperity, ambitious persons, in order to win power and influence, seek to weaken the hands of the constituted authority by creating dissensions and discord.

See also 13:32.</p><p>الطیر (the birds) means, a bird or birds. طائر which is the singular of الطیر means, a bird; an omen; the cause of actions good or bad; actions good or bad and their consequences; natural powers of man; a highly righteous and spiritual man (Lane &amp; Aqrab). As a bird flies high in the air and builds its nest on lofty trees or mountains, therefore a man who soars high in the spiritual firmament is called a طائر in spiritual terminology. See also 3:50; 7:132 &amp; 17:14.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>This verse has been very much misunderstood and misinterpreted. The misunderstanding arises from the far-fetched construction placed upon it by some commentators. There is, however, nothing in the wording of the verse itself to justify the element of mystery introduced into it. A few simple words used metaphorically in order to add elegance and beauty to the diction of the verse have been distorted to render it a veritable riddle. The words \"We subjected the mountains and the birds to celebrate God’s praise with David\" have been taken literally to mean that the mountains and birds were under David’s control and when he sang the praises of God they actually joined with him in singing those praises. They simply mean that big men (الجبال) and highly spiritual men (الطیر) glorified God and sang Divine praises along with David. And if according to the verse, the mountains and birds were subjected to David there was nothing extraordinary in the mountains and the birds being subject to his control as at several other places in the Quran not only mountains and birds but all other things in the heavens and the earth—the sun, the moon, the stars, the day and the night, the animals, the birds, the rivers, the seas, the winds, the clouds etc., are stated to have been subjected to man (2:165; 7:55; 22:38 &amp; 45:13-14). The word الجبال; in the present verse, as stated under Important Words above, signifies also mountainous territory or \"people living in the mountains\" as the name of a place sometimes stands for its people (12:83). Thus the subjection of \"the mountains\" to David may signify that he conquered and subjugated wild and savage mountain tribes. The Bible also refers to this fact. It says, \"And Hiram, King of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons and they built David a house. So all the elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron; and King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord and they appointed David King over Israel\" ( II Sam. chap. 5). Thus the words, \"We subjected the mountains and the birds to celebrate God’s praises with David\" have been particularly used about David in the verse because he was a great conqueror and subduer of wild mountain tribes.</p><p>Similarly, celebration by birds and mountains of God’s praises should also occasion no surprise. Elsewhere in the Quran we read that all things, animate or inanimate, the angels, animals, birds, the heavens and the earth, even the forces of nature, sing the praises of God, only man cannot understand their glorification (13:14; 17:45; 21:20-21; 24:42; 59:2; 61:2; 62:2; &amp; 64:2). The glorification of God by these things which is the carrying out by them of the duties assigned to them by God demonstrate: that God is perfect and completely free from all flaws, failings and frailties and so is His handiwork.</p><p>The word \"birds\" used in the verse may also signify actual birds. In this sense the reference would be that David made free use of birds for carrying messages in time of war which had been especially trained for this purpose. Or it may signify flocks of birds which followed David’s victorious armies and feasted on the dead bodies of his fallen foes. Lastly, the word \"birds,\" may signify men of high determination and great resolve who are ever ready to scale great heights and are not afraid of difficulties and dangers in the cause of religion. In brief, the verse means to say that men of ordinary spiritual caliber had become highly spiritual and soared very high in the spiritual firmament through the purifying company of David.</p><p>The verse may also be rendered as, \"We subjected the mountains and the birds to David; they all celebrated God’s praises.\" This rendering removes much misunderstanding and difficulty.</p><p>For a fuller explanation of this and the next three verses see 34:11-14 &amp; 38:19, 20, 37, 38, 39.</p><p>The expression, \"We gave Solomon the right understanding of the matter,\" has been used to show that Solomon’s policy of moderation and conciliation was right in the then obtaining circumstances. In this verse the Quran defends Solomon against the charge levelled at him by some Jewish writers of having pursued a weak policy which brought about the downfall of his dynasty after him. The words, however, should not be taken to mean that the strong policy adopted by David in his own time was wrong. Any misunderstanding leading to this inference has been dispelled by the following clause: \"And to each of them We gave wisdom and knowledge,\" which makes it quite clear that the policies of both David and Solomon were best in the circumstances and quite suited to the particular occasion.</p>"

It appears that the vessels of Solomon plied in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea and regular trade was carried on between Palestine and the countries lying round the Persian Gulf and these two seas.</p><p>\"The commercial activity of Solomon seems to have been extensive. In this respect, he reminds us of the Pharaohs, who appear almost to have monopolized the foreign commerce of Egypt. His imports were on a scale so lavish that he is said to have made silver as common as stones, cedars as sycamores, in Jerusalem. There was an extensive trade in horses (1 Kings 10:27-29).In partnership with Hiram of Tyre he maintained a fleet of ocean-going ships trading at regular intervals to Mediterranean ports, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks (1 Kings 10:22). In his trading ventures down the Gulf of ‘Akaba he was assisted by skilled Tyrian navigators supplied by Hiram (1 Kings 9:27, 29), his own people never did take kindly to the sea. This passage was evidently misunderstood by the chronicler, who took it to mean that Hiram supplied the ships (2 Chron. 8:18); how they were transported is a problem he leaves unexplained. Ophir, the land to which these vessels ventured, is not identified with certainty, but may be S. Arabia. Solomon brought Israel for the first time fully into a current of oriental commerce and civilization, and during his reign Jerusalem, at any rate, was a city of wealth and luxury\" (Enc. Brit, 14th edit. under \"Solomon\"). In Jew. Enc. under \"Solomon\" we read: \"With the Phoenicians he united in maritime commerce, sending out a fleet once in three years from Ezion-geber, at the head of the gulf of ‘Akaba to Ophir, presumably on the eastern coast of the Arabian peninsula. From this distant port, and others on the way, he derived fabulous amounts of gold and tropical products. These revenues gave him almost unlimited means for increasing the glory of his capital city and palaces, and for the perfection of his civil and military organizations.\"</p><p>In the present verse the adjective used about the wind is عاصفة (violent) while in 38:37 it is رخاء (gentle) which shows that though the wind blew fast, it was gentle and did no damage to Solomon’s ships.</p><p>The implied reference in the present and the preceding two verses may be to the great military might and economic progress and prosperity which the Muslims were to attain in the heyday of their glory which they achieved during the reigns of the Omayyad and the Abbasid dynasties.</p>"

It appears, however, that ‘Uz was situated somewhere in the north of Arabia, between Syria and the Gulf of ‘Akaba. It is said that Job lived there before the departure of the Israelites from Egypt. According to some Jewish writers he lived about 200 years before Moses. According to some other authorities, however, he was a compatriot of Moses, but he was not an Israelite Prophet, having descended from Esau, the elder brother of Israel. Of all the books of the Old Testament, the Book of Job is unique in this respect that with the exception of the word Jehovah, which is the Jewish name for God, the whole history of the Mosaic Law and that of the Jews is conspicuous by its absence in it. See also 6:85.</p><p>The story of Job is said to bear a close resemblance with Harish Chander, a Hindu saint and a rich man. The language of the Book of Job which is Hebrew with various Armaisms and with a faint Arabic tinge is the language which was spoken by the Jews between the 9th and 4th centuries B.C. and that is the time (6th century B.C.) when some Israelite tribes after the Great Dispersion were banished to Afghanistan and Kashmir by Nebuchadnezzar and other Babylonian kings. There they came in contact with the Hindus, and studied their history, mythology and folklore. Whether or not the author of the Book of Job while writing this book borrowed from Hindu popular literature it is difficult to say. But Muslim commentators of the Quran extensively borrowed from the Book of Job, and drawing upon their own imagination added most fantastic and unbelievable details to Job’s account in their commentaries and ended by making the whole account a veritable fairy tale.</p><p>The Quran has confined itself to mentioning a few relevant facts about Job in the present and the next verse. It tells us that Job was a holy man of God, that he had to suffer great hardships and privations as a result of which he became separated from his family and followers who subsequently were made to join him, his followers having increased manifold in the meantime.</p><p>Job has also been mentioned in vv. 4:164; 6:85 &amp; 38:42 and everywhere he has been mentioned along with the Prophets David and Solomon. This shows that like these two great Prophets he was a man of influence and affluence and like them he had to pass through trials and tribulations which he bore with exemplary patience and fortitude. The courage and fortitude displayed by Job under very severe affliction and distress has become proverbial. See also Jew. Enc., under \"Job\" and Enc. of Islam under \"Ayyub\" and explanatory notes under 6:85 &amp; 38:42.</p>"

Muslim commentators of the Quran identify him with several persons, chiefly with Biblical Prophets. But the Prophet known by this name appears to be Ezekiel who is called Dhul-Kifl by the Arabs. There seems to exist a close resemblance between the words ذوالکفل and حزقیل (Ezekiel), both in form and meaning, the former word meaning \"possessed of an abundant portion\" and the latter \"God gives strength.\" Thus the two words seem to possess an identical significance. Rodwell says that Ezekiel is called Dhul-Kifl by the Arabs.</p><p>According to Karsten Niebuhr, a little town called Kefil which is situated midway between Najaf and Huila (Babylon) contains the shrine of Ezekiel which is still visited by Jewish pilgrims. He is further of the view that Kifl is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The Jews too regard Ezekiel as Dhul-Kifl (Enc. of Islam under \"Dhul-Kifl\" and Carsten Niebuhr’s \"Travels through Arabia…\" ii, 265). See also 38:49.</p><p>Born probably about 622 B.C. in a priestly family Dhul-Kifl had spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Judah. In 592 B.C. at the age of thirty he received the Call and began to preach against idol worship and the injustice and immorality of his people. In the meantime, Babylon had taken the place of Assyria as the dominant power in Western Asia and Judah had acknowledged its over lordship. But Jehoiakim, the King of Judah under the influence of his evil councillors revolted against the authority of Babylon, thus drawing upon himself the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar who successfully besieged Jerusalem in 597 and carried into exile many of her leading citizens, including Ezekiel and Jehoiachin, a king of three months’ standing—his father Jehoiakim having meanwhile died. Jehoiachin was succeeded by his uncle, Zedekiah, who for a time remained faithful to Babylon, but foolishly depending upon the support of Egypt he renounced his allegiance to Babylon, an act which Ezekiel bitterly resented and denounced as treachery to Yahweh Himself. The result was that Jerusalem was invested by Nebuchadnezzar, and after a siege of eighteen months was destroyed amid horrors untold. The Temple on which such a passion of love had been lavished was reduced to ashes and the people deported to Babylon (586 B.C.).</p><p>Such was the situation which confronted Ezekiel. In 592 B.C. five years before the downfall he had foreseen it and with some detail had predicted it and had warned the Jews of the impending disaster. The first terrific blow by Babylon in 597 B.C. had left the Jews unconvinced of the probability of their imminent political extinction—a probability which to Ezekiel was a certainty as clear as noonday. But as Ezekiel foretold the destruction of the Jews so did he predict their restoration. The picture drawn by him of the salvation in store for his people is as gracious and brilliant as his forecast of their downfall had been stern. His prophecy of the restoration and return to Jerusalem was based upon a vision which he had seen (Ezekiel, ch. 37) and to which a reference is to be found in the Quran also (2:260). Ezekiel’s book is full of prophecies. He foretold the destruction and eventual restoration and rehabilitation of the Jews. He also made a prophecy about the great rise of Christian nations of the west and of communism and a prophecy about the equally great decline and downfall of both (chapters 38:39).</p><p>But he did not live long to see the return of the Jews to Jerusalem, because he died in captivity in 570 B.C. at the age of 52. From the Book of Ezekiel it appears that he was a great admirer of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon. According to him Nebuchadnezzar was justified in taking the severe steps that he took against Egypt, Tyre and the Israelites. The destruction and sack of Jerusalem was the result of the Israelites’ own iniquity and wickedness. He, along with the Prophet Jeremiah, was in favour </p><p>of supporting the Babylonian government and for this support both these Prophets were condemned as traitors by the Jewish priests of the time, just as Jesus was condemned as a traitor for supporting the Roman government in the time of Titus, and the Promised Messiah in our own time was condemned as a traitor and a sycophant for preferring British rule in India to that of the Sikhs. Ezekiel and Daniel are called the Prophets of the Exile (Holy Bible edited by C.I. Scofield and Peak’s \"Commentary of the Bible\").</p>"

Every one of these three kinds of ظلم constitutes a wrong done to oneself (Lane, Aqrab, Raghib &amp; Taj). See also 2:18. The word ظلم and its derivatives, as used in five daily Prayers, commonly fall under the third category. Thus when a supplicant uses the word with regard to himself in Prayer, he only means that he has done something which has brought trouble or distress upon him or which has exposed him to danger; it does not necessarily mean that he has committed a sin. It is in this sense that this word has been used in the verse under comment and it is in this sense that Moses used the expression انی ظلمت نفسی i.e. I have wronged my soul (28:17).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>ذوالنون (Dhun-Nun) literally meaning \"the man of the fish\" is the name of the Prophet Jonah or as he is called Yunus in the Quran (10:99). He has also been called صاحب الحوت (Companion of the Fish) in the Quran (68:49).</p><p>The verse does not specify the cause of Jonah’s anger. It must be the obstinate refusal of his people to accept his message because for a prophet to become angry with God is inconceivable. The Elect of God do not even speak nor do they act until God commands them to do so (21:28). Most of the English translators of the Quran have translated the words لن نقدر علیه as \"We had no power over him. \"Of this rendering the author of the Lisan says: \"none will interpret it in this way except one who is ignorant of the Arabic language and the meanings of its words. \"According to this lexicon the expression means: 'We will not straiten him' or 'We will not decree against him any distress.' Lane also agrees with Lisan in this respect. The word قدر has also been used in this sense elsewhere in the Quran. See 17:31; 28:83; &amp; 65:8. For a fuller account of the Prophet Jonah see 10:99.</p>"

Jesus’ unusual birth marked a transitional stage. He had an Israelite mother but not an Israelite father. The next prophet was not to be from the House of Israel. With him the gift of prophethood, in accordance with the Biblical prophecy (Deut. 18:18), was to be transferred from the House of Israel to that of Ishmael.

This is no mere coincidence and it has not been done haphazardly. The mentioning together of these Prophets serves a definite purpose and is done deliberately. All of them had one thing in common. They all suffered great hardships and distress in one form or another and displayed the highest and noblest form of patience and endurance under severest trials. First of all, Job is mentioned. The tribulations through which he had to pass were perhaps the severest. Besides 21:84 above, the Quran describes the affliction of Job and the patience with which he bore it in the following verses:</p><p>And remember Our servant Job, when he cried to his Lord, Satan has smitten me with affliction and torment…Indeed We found him patient. An excellent servant was he. Surely he always turned to God (38:42-45).</p><p>After Job are mentioned Ishmael, Idris and Dhul-Kifl. Ishmael was yet a baby when along with his mother Hagar he was made to live in the arid and bleak valley of Mecca where at that time not a blade of grass grew and not a drop of water was to be found, and he was only a small boy when a most severe trial faced him. His father Abraham saw in a dream that he was slaughtering him. Ishmael evinced complete readiness to give his life in fulfilment of his father’s dream. The Prophet Idris had to face a virulent campaign of denunciation and calumny by his people and he suffered all that abuse with great patience. Dhul-Kifl or Ezekiel was carried away in captivity when Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, sacked Jerusalem in the 6th century B. C. He passed much of his time in prison. The case of Jonah is well known. He too had to pass through a great ordeal. He remained in the belly of the fish for three consecutive days and when the whale vomited him out it was on a naked tract of land. He put up with his ordeal with becoming fortitude. Zachariah had reached an extreme old age. His wife was barren and he had no son. The grief that there would be no one left after him to perpetuate his line and to lead his people to the way of righteousness, as all his heirs were godless men, consumed him and in the intensity of grief he prayed to God to bless him with a son. Mary gave birth to Jesus without the agency of a husband and on that account she was subjected to abuse and calumny of the most wicked and vicious type. She bore all this agony with a patience that befitted a really godly woman. So it appears that all the above-mentioned prophets and righteous servants of God bore a striking resemblance to one another in this one respect that they all had to face great trials and hardships and like the beloved ones of God all bore them with a brave and resigned heart and a smiling face.</p>"

This meaning of the verse is supported by a well-known saying of the Holy Prophet according to which a companion of his named ‘Abdullah was slain in a battle. The Prophet told ‘Abdullah’s son, Jabir, that he had seen in a dream that God was so pleased with his father that He had asked ‘Abdullah what thing he would love to have so that the same might be given to him, and ‘Abdullah replied that he wished to be sent back to the world so that he might fight and be slain again in the cause of truth, to which God the Almighty said: \"This cannot be because the word has gone forth from Me that the dead shall not return to the world\" (Majah &amp; Nasa’i).</p>"

It is also a conjunction like واو signifying, \"and\" or rather \"even\". It is also used as an inceptive article. They say أکلت السمک حتی رأسھا; the word رأس having three readings. According to the first reading it has a <i>kasra</i> (<i>ra’siha</i>), according to the second <i>fatha</i> (<i>ra’saha</i>) and according to the third <i>zamma</i> (<i>ra’soha</i>). The sentence according to these readings respectively means:(1) I ate the fish even to its head; (2) I ate the fish even (and) its head; (3) I ate the fish so that its head was eaten. The particle also denotes a cause or motive signifying, to the end that, or in order that, or so that, as in the saying أسلم حتی تدخل الجنة i.e. be a Muslim so that thou mayest enter Paradise. It is also used in the sense of الا i.e. except (Lane, Aqrab &amp; Mufradat).</p><p>یأجوج و مأجوج (Gog and Magog) are both derived from أج (<i>ajja</i>). They sayأجت النار i.e. the fire burned or burned fiercely. أج(<i>ajja</i>) means, he hastened or was quick in his pace; he or it became the flaming fire (Lane &amp; Aqrab). The words: یأجوجand مأجوج are both derived from this root. They refer to the Scythians of the furthest East...or as some say, all nations inhabiting the north of Asia and of Europe (see Enc. Brit. and Jewish Encyclopaedia under \"Gog\" and \"Magog\", and \" Historians’ History of the World\" vol. 2, p. 582 and Ezekiel 38: 2-6 &amp; 39: 6). The words may also apply to the Christian nations of the West as they have made much use of the burning fire and boiling water and because all their material progress and great discoveries and inventions are due to the proper use of these things. Or the words may imply the restlessness of these nations as they are always on the lookout restlessly and impatiently to make new conquests. See also 16:18.</p><p>حدب (height) is inf. noun from حدب (<i>hadiba</i>) which means, it rose high or grew up high. حدب (<i>hadabun</i>) means, high or elevated ground. حدب من الارض means, rugged or high ground. The word also means a wave; a slope in a declivity. حدب الماءmeans, the elevated waves of water or the rolling water in waves. The Quranic expression من کل حدب ینسلون means, they will occupy every vantage point and will dominate the whole world and excel all nations (Lane &amp; Aqrab).</p><p>ینسلون (shall hasten forth) is formed from نسل. They say نسل الولد i.e. he begot a son. نسل الرجل means, his progeny multiplied. نسل فی مشیه means, he hastened in his walk (Aqrab &amp; Mufradat).</p><p>فتحت (let loose) signifies that the Christian nations of the West will spread all over the world and dominate it.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The description of Gog and Magog as given in the Bible leaves no doubt about the fact that it applies to some Christian powers of the west: Firstly, because they are represented as very numerous and powerful and mighty and their numbers as further swelling by their allies. Says the Bible:</p><p>Thou shalt ascend, and come like a storm, Thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands and many people with thee (Ezek. 38:9). Gog and Magog... the number of whom is as the sand of the sea (Rev. 20:8). Every feathered fowl, and every beast of the field is thus addressed, ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth (Ezek. 39:18,19).</p><p>Secondly, they are shown coming forth from the northern parts of the earth, and from the isles: \"And thou (o Gog) shalt come from thy place out of the north, thou, and many people with thee\" (Ezek. 38:15). Thirdly, they will spread all over the world: \"They went up on the breadth of the earth\" (Rev. 20:9). Fourthly, from their home in the north, they will migrate to other lands and settle in all the four corners of the earth and in time of war they will gather together from their distant colonies: \"Satan.... shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle\" (Rev. 20:8).Fifthly, the very root meaning of the words 'Gog' and 'Magog,' as shown under \"Important Words,\" points to western Christian nations as the nations referred to in the above Biblical prophecies.</p><p>The name Gog first occurs in 1 Chr. 5:4, where he is mentioned as a descendant of Joel.</p><p>But Ezek. 38:3, and 39: 1, speak of Gog as 'prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal', evidently Rosh standing for Russia, Meshech for Moscow and Tubal for To bolsk. Gog is also spoken of as 'of the land of Magog' (Ezek. 38:2) and Magog, in this verse of the Bible, according to the commentators of the Bible represents the regions which of old went by the name of Scythia (including Russia and Tartary), from which in the past issued many hordes of barbarians. As Russia was included in the land of Magog, Rosh, Meshech and Tubal must be taken as standing for Russia, Moscow and Tobolsk.</p><p>Magog was the second of Japheth’s sons (Gen. 10:2) and his descendants seem to have given their name to the land referred to in Ezek. 38:2. But Magog has also been spoken of as the name of a people in Ezek. 39:6 and in Rev. 20:8. In the former, Magog has been mentioned along with those 'that dwell carelessly in the isles.' These passages also show that Gog and Magog represent some of the great Powers of Europe, including Russia.</p><p>Gog and Magog have also been mentioned elsewhere in the Quran (18:95). There they have been spoken of as making raids into territories on the northern border of Iran, which means that they were the tribes generally known as Scythians. It is a known historical fact that in olden times the Scythians continued to move in large bodies from Asia into Europe, their route lying north of the Caucasus. (Enc. Brit. vol. 12, p. 263. 14th edit.). As one horde settled down in Europe new hordes came forth from the east, pushing their predecessors further and further West. Thus the nations of Europe have been legitimately called Gog and Magog in the Biblical prophecy. It is curious that the memory of two heroes named Gog and Magog is preserved to this day in Guild Hall (London) in the form of two statues. The original effigies which were destroyed in the Great Fire in the sixteenth century are known to have existed in the time of Henry V. These heroes seem to have been connected with Britain from very ancient times.</p><p>Again, from \"Ezekiel\" and \"Revelation\" it appears that Gog and Magog will make their appearance in the Latter Days i.e. in the time just before the second coming of the Messiah: \"After many years thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword\" (Ezek. 38:8). \"It shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land\" (Ezek. 38:16). See also Rev. 20:7-10. These verses show that the prophecy refers to a people who were to have appeared in the distant future. That distant future is the time through which we are now passing and the mighty people of whom the prophecy speaks are the great Christian powers of the west. The following prophecy in Ezekiel shows that the age in which Gog and Magog were to make their appearance was to be marked by wars, earthquakes, pestilences and terrible catastrophes:</p><p>And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, (by Israel is here meant the true Israel—the followers of Islam) saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel. So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be against his brother (And on that day We shall leave some of them to surge against others—Quran, 18:100). And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord\" (38:18-23). See also 18:84, 100 &amp; 102.</p><p>The present verse when read in conjunction with its predecessor purports to say that the law of nature works in this way that once a people after the heyday of their grandeur and glory, fall a victim to death and destruction they never regain their lost glory. But it further says that a new phenomenon will take place in the time of Gog and Magog. After their power and might will have gone to pieces and their glory departed the followers of Islam will again come into their own and regain their former greatness, grandeur and glory after they had lost all hope of regeneration. Gog and Magog or the Christian nations of the west have now scaled all the heights of political power and have spread over the whole world which has become divided into two opposite armed camps, viz. Western democracies and their allies on one side and communism and its satellites on the other. One part of the prophecy has been fulfilled, the other part about the complete and utter destruction of Gog and Magog is awaiting fulfilment. The signs of its fulfilment are already apparent on the horizon.</p><p>The verse may also signify that the nations that had been subjugated by western Christian powers and had groaned under their cruel exploitation and heartless tyranny will rise to new life again when Christian Powers will begin to deteriorate and fall, after having attained to the highest pinnacles of material glory.</p>"

                    "note": "<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>By الارض (the land) is meant Palestine. It is worthy of note that Christian commentators themselves have interpreted the phrase 'inherit the land' or 'inherit the earth' in the Psalms as meaning, 'inherit Canaan, the pledge of God’s covenant.' (\"Commentary on the Old Testament,\" published by The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, notes on Ps. 37:3, 9). The reference in the words, \"in the Book of David\" is to Psalms 37: 9,11,18,22 &amp; 29, where it is stated:</p><p>For evildoers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be forever... For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut; The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.</p><p>The word الذکر may also refer to Torah, the Book of Moses. There is a prophecy in Deuteronomy (28: 11 &amp; 34: 4) that Palestine was to be given to the Israelites:</p><p>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant .... And the Lord said unto him, this is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed.</p><p>The Israelites rose to great power after Moses and in the time of David and Solomon their rule extended far and wide till it embraced in its orbit far-off lands. Then they fell on evil days. They sinned and transgressed and killed God’s Prophets with the result that Divine nemesis overtook them. First Samaria was conquered and ravaged by the Assyrians about 733 B.C. and the whole country north of Israel was annexed by them. Then under Pharaoh Necho, the Egyptians ravaged Judah in 608 B.C. and last of all the greatest blow fell on Israel when Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, laid waste Judah, killed in cold blood the inhabitants of Jerusalem and burned and razed the holy Temple of Solomon to the ground and carried away in captivity the members of the royal family and their Prophets. After wandering in wilderness for about a century the Israelites were restored to Jerusalem and to some of their lost glory through the instrumentality of Cyrus, the Persian king and his successors. To this restoration the following passage of the Bible makes a prophetic reference from the mouth of Moses:</p><p>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee—thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.... And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers (Deut. 30:1-5).</p><p>Again the Israelites relapsed into sin and iniquity. They opposed and persecuted God’s Messengers and the cup of their wickedness became full to the brim when they hung on the cross Jesus, their last great Prophet. Then God’s wrath fell upon them. The Roman hordes under Titus attacked them in 70 A.D. and amid circumstances of unparalleled horror Jerusalem was destroyed and the Temple of Solomon was burnt down for the second time (Enc. Bib. &amp; Jew. Enc. under \"Jerusalem\"). To this double disaster of the Israelites vv. 17:5-8 of the Quran make a pointed reference.</p><p>Palestine, the Holy Land, remained in the hands of Christians till Muslims conquered it in the Caliphate of ‘Umar, the Second Successor of the Holy Prophet, and unlike Nebuchadnezzar and Titus he accorded such benign and kind treatment to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and showed such respect and reverence to the Temple of Solomon as are unparalleled in the whole annals of foreign conquest. It is to this conquest of Palestine by Muslim arms that the prophecy embodied in the verse under comment particularly refers. Palestine remained under Muslim possession for about 1350 years with the exception of a brief space of 92 years when during the Crusades it changed hands, till in our own time through the evil designs of some so-called democratic Christian powers, the country of the name of Palestine has altogether ceased to exist and on its ruins the State of Israel has been built. The Jews have come to their own after wandering in wilderness for about 2000 years. But this great historical event, too, has taken place in fulfilment of a Quranic prophecy. The Muslims were told that in the time of the Promised Messiah, the Jews will be made to come back to their Holy Land from the ends of the earth (17:105). But this is only a temporary phase. The Muslims are destined to win it back. Let the whole world know that sooner or later—sooner rather than later—Palestine will revert to Muslim possession. This is a Divine decree and nobody can alter God’s decree.</p>"
