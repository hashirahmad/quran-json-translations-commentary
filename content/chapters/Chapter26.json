Benignant, All-Hearing and All-Knowing; the letter ط representing the Divine attribute لطیف (Benignant), س representing سمیع (All-Hearing) and م standing for علیم (All-Knowing). These مقطعات show that in the present and the following few <i>Surahs</i>, which are similar and subordinate to the present <i>Surah</i>, in subject-matter, light has been shed on the fact that God is humanity’s Great Benefactor; He is Kind and Compassionate to His servants; He hears their prayers and supplications and knows the inmost secrets of their hearts and all their needs and requirements and fulfils them. They further show that light has also been thrown in these <i>Surahs</i> on the laws and rules which regulate and govern the universe and thus demonstrate Divine Majesty, Dignity and Glory and that sound and solid arguments have been given to support and substantiate what the Quran asserts and claims. These مقطعات give such a beautiful and complete picture of Divine attributes as no other revealed Scripture has done and by implication exhort a Muslim to assimilate and develop in his person these attributes because God has created man in His own image and to the extent to which he assimilates Divine attributes, to that extent he rises morally and spiritually and becomes his Creator’s manifestation.</p><p>The present and next two <i>Surahs</i> form a special group known as the طسم (Ta Sin Mim) group. These three <i>Surahs</i> bear a very close resemblance to each other in their subject-matter and were revealed in the same period at Mecca. As all of them deal particularly with the life-story of Moses in some detail, some commentators of the Quran have taken the abbreviated letters طسم as standing for Mount Sinai and Moses; طس standing for طور سیناء (Mount Sinai) and م for موسی (Moses).</p><p>The fact that the present <i>Surah</i> and 28th <i>Surah</i> are prefixed with the abbreviated letters طسم and give a much more detailed account of the different phases of Moses’ chequered life, coupled with the fact that the 27th <i>Surah</i> has only طس placed in its beginning (the letter م having been significantly omitted) and makes only a very brief reference to him, lends additional weight to the inference that this letter stands for Moses.</p><p>It may also be added that the three Divine attributes Benignant, All-Hearing and All-Knowing have also a strong bearing on the life story of Moses, related in some detail in these three <i>Surahs</i>.</p><p>For a detailed explanation, however, of مقطعات (abbreviated letters) see 2:2 &amp; 19:2.</p>"

See also 2:169.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The word مبین as its meanings show, points to the following three salient features of the Quran, viz. (1) that it not only states facts and makes prophecies and lays down laws and ordinances but also supports and substantiates what it says and claims by solid arguments and sound reasons; (2) that it is not only clear in itself but makes clear the obscurities and ambiguities that are to be found in previous revealed scriptures; and (3) that all that is essential for the attainment of nearness to God and all that relates to the laws of the Shari‘ah, to ethics and to matters of belief has been made quite clear in it.</p><p>This is a quality which the Quran possesses to the entire exclusion of all other revealed Books. Other scriptures are only مستبین (clear in themselves) but the Quran is not only مستبین but is also مبین (makes clear the obscurities that are to be found in other Books). What adds to the beauty of the Quran as کتاب مبین (clear and perspicuous Book) is that all its teachings are in perfect harmony with کتاب مکنون(preserved Book) i.e. pure and unsullied nature.</p>"

Briefly, it may be stated here that the rod of Moses did not actually turn into a serpent. It appeared to the audience as if it were a serpent. In fact, it was a vision of Moses in which the whole assembly were made to join. Now a rod in a vision symbolizes a community and the serpent an enemy. Thus by the miraculous happening Moses was made to understand that if he cast away his people from him, they would become veritable serpents but if he kept them under his fostering care they would grow into a strong and well-knit community and would not only become men of light and learning themselves but would also impart these things to others.</p><p>Moses’ white hand seemed also to signify that the great spiritual movement he had founded would one day enlighten the world with divine light and that his teaching would radiate and his people would undergo a complete transformation, and would become a community of highly righteous men. In fact, noble and righteous servants of God to whom He entrusts the task of bringing about a great change in the lives of his people become invested with a divine light which sometimes takes a material form and is seen by other people also.</p>"

The Israelites were between the devil and the deep sea. The sea was before them and the mighty hosts of Pharaoh were coming from behind in hot pursuit. Complete destruction stared them in the face, and in utter despair they cried \"We are surely overtaken.\" But Moses’ faith in his Lord was as strong as ever, nay it shone forth with greater effulgence in the face of the extreme peril. To the cry of despair of his companions Moses replied, most emphatically, and in words expressive of complete confidence and trust in God. \"We shall never be overtaken,\" he said, \"My Lord is with me.\" This is how God’s Elect stand firm and unshaken like a rock in the midst of severest trials. God purposely makes them pass through hard ordeals to show to the world the invincibility of their trust in God and His own regard for them. They emerge from these ordeals triumphant. This has happened in the time of every Prophet of God. Its brightest example is to be seen in the life of the Holy Prophet of Islam.</p>"

Islam claims and enjoys this superiority over all other religions that the God Whom it presents to the world is a Living God Who answers the prayers of His servants and speaks to them. It is only in Islam that its righteous followers hear the sweet voice of God. This greatest Divine boon is now denied to the followers of all other faiths. This fact alone constitutes an unanswerable evidence of Islam being a living faith and other religions being devoid of life.</p>"

The name ‘Ad is found in ancient books of geography which shows that a people bearing this name did indeed live in the past. The tribe has also been called ‘Adi Iram in the Quran, (89:8). The Quran has also mentioned the following facts about this tribe: (1) They built lofty buildings and no other people in Arabia attained to that height of power to which they had attained (89:9). (2) They lived immediately after Noah. (3) They built monuments on elevated places (26:129) of which the ruins still exist in Arabia. (4) The territory in which these people lived was called Ahqaf (46:22) which literally means meandering and zigzag sandhills. (5) They were destroyed by a violent wind which continued to blow over their territory consecutively for seven days, burying their chief cities under heaps of sand and dust (69:7-8). (6) The history of these people has now become wrapped in obscurity (46:26).</p>"

They had made great progress in science in their time. They built fortresses, palatial buildings and great reservoirs. They had their summer residences, their factories and mechanical works. They were specially advanced in architecture. They invented new weapons and implements of war and erected great monuments. In short, like the present-day nations of the west, they possessed all the complicated paraphernalia of a highly advanced civilization. They made great strides in knowledge but they consigned to oblivion the one supreme lesson of history, viz. that nations derive their real strength not from material things but from high ideals and good morals.

So this time also there is going to be no punishment.\" Taking the word in the sense of 'religion' the verse would mean, \"the religion which is being presented to us is nothing new.

According to Abu Isma‘il, the author of <i>Futuhush-Sham</i>, they were a very powerful people. Their rule and dominion had extended from Busra, a town in Syria to Aden. They had made great progress in agriculture and architecture. They were a highly civilized and cultured people. The tribe has been mentioned by Greek historians. They place it in a period not long before the Christian era. Hijr or Agra, as they call it, is given as the home of these people. Al-Hijr which has also been known as <i>Mada’ini Salih</i> (the Cities of Salih) and which seems to have been the capital of these people lies between Medina and Tabuk, and the valley in which it is situated is called Wadi Qura. The Quran represents them as the immediate successors of ‘Ad (7:75). From 40:31-32, it appears that they lived before the time of Moses. It is worthy of note that the accounts of the Prophets Noah, Hud and Salih have been given at various places in the Quran and everywhere the order observed is the same, viz. the account of Noah precedes that of Hud and the account of Hud precedes that of Salih, which is the true chronological order. This shows that the Quran gives accurately and in their true historical order the facts of history long consigned to oblivion and quite wrapped in obscurity. For a fuller note on Thamud see 11:62.</p>"

The difference between ندامة which is infinitive noun from this verb and توبة is that whereas ندامة means grieving for or regretting a thing that has been done, توبة means the giving up of sins completely for their evilness, coupled with regret and grief for what has passed and the determination to see that it does not occur again and with the resolve to make amends for the moral lapse committed. This is why when a sinner regrets his evil deeds he is called نادم but when he repents of his sins and completely eschews them and is fully resolved against their recurrence and makes amends for the past lapses and turns to God, he is called تائب (Lane).</p>"

See also 15:79.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The word الایکة seems to refer to Midian in the neighbourhood of which there existed tangled and luxuriant trees after which these people or a section thereof were called اصحاب الایکة. Midian lay in the Sinai Peninsula, a few miles from the sea. It was originally the name of a tribe who were descended from Abraham through Katurah and who had settled in the locality known after their ancestor Midian, son of Katurah.</p><p>The fact that according to the Quran the Prophet Shu‘aib was sent both to اصحاب الایکة i.e. People of the Wood and اصحاب مدین i.e. People of Midian (7:86 &amp; 11:85) shows that both these were the names of two sections of the same people, Shu‘aib particularly belonging to the section known as مدین, because where in the Quran he is stated as having been sent to صدین he is described as \"their brother\" and where he is mentioned as having been sent to اصحاب الایکة the words \"their brother\" are omitted.</p><p>Further evidence of the close relationship of the \"People of the Wood\" with the \"People of Midian\" is furnished by the fact that identical faults have been ascribed in the Quran to both. Compare 26:182-184, 7:86 &amp; 11:85-86. It may further be noted that Midian was both the name of the tribe and the town in which they lived. It was situated at the head of the gulf of Aqaba and near it was the wilderness or <i>Aikah </i>abounding in dwarf trees of the species of wild plumbs and affording shelter to camels, sheep and goats.

(1) \"I am unto you a Messenger faithful to my trust\"; (2) \"fear Allah and obey me; \" and (3) \"I ask you no reward for it.\" These three strikingly similar statements lead to three very important conclusions, namely, (1) that every Prophet is the first believer in the truth of his mission; (2) that having become himself first convinced of his truth he proceeds to convey his message to his people; and (3) that his services to his people are quite sincere and selfless and are born of no motive of self-interest and self-seeking. Similarly, like chapters 7th and 11th a detailed reference has been made in the present <i>Surah</i> to these five Prophets in the same order. In addition to the two fundamental teachings of all religions, viz. Unity of God and obedience to the Prophet of the time, great emphasis has been laid in the case of each Prophet on the vice from which his people particularly suffered. Noah’s people seemed to have been divided into water-tight compartments and the socially well-to-do among them suffered from an exaggerated notion of false superiority. They would not mix with the poorer sections of the society and the main cause of their rejection of Noah was that persons of poor social status and low intellect had accepted him. The Adites or the tribe of Hud took great pride in their military exploits, architectural achievements and in their factories and chemical works. The people of Salih gloried in their power, prestige and wealth. Lot’s people shamelessly indulged in most unnatural and depraved sexual vice, while those of Shu‘aib were dishonest in their commercial dealings. Each one of these vices has been separately dealt with in the account of the Prophet whose people particularly suffered from it. This is the way of Divine Prophets that, besides stressing the basic principles of religion, they lay special emphasis on the particular vice from which their people are found to suffer. In our own time, in view of mad hankering after material wealth and physical comforts which has held all the nations of the world in its firm grip and in view of callous indifference towards spiritual matters, Ahmad, the Promised Messiah, used to take from every new convert a pledge to the effect that he would prefer religion to material interests.</p>"

In fact, God has reserved to Himself the right when and whom to punish and whom to spare.

Both are the attributive names of the Archangel Gabriel who was the medium through whom Divine revelation came to the Holy Prophet. The epithet روح القدس has been used to point to the eternal and complete freedom from every error or blemish in the Quran and the use of the epithet الروح الامین implies that it shall continue to enjoy Divine protection against all attempts to tamper with its text. This latter epithet has been used exclusively with regard to the revelation of the Quran because the promise of everlasting Divine protection was held out to no other Divine Scripture and their texts, in course of time came to be interfered and tampered with. Strangely enough, the Holy Prophet himself was known as الامین (the trustworthy) at Mecca. What a great Divine tribute to, and evidence of, the trustworthiness of the Quran that its revelation was brought by an <i>Amin</i> to an <i>Amin</i>!</p>"

The verse also implies reference to a famous prophecy of Moses (Deut. 18:18) in which it is stated that God would put His words in the mouth of the Prophet whom He would raise from among the brethren of the Israelites. Of all revealed scriptures, the Quran stands unique in this respect that from beginning to end it is the spoken Word of God (کلام اللّٰه).</p><p>The allusion in the words \"on thy heart\" may also be to the purity of the Holy Prophet’s heart and his perfect aptitude for receiving Divine revelation to which a beautiful reference has also been made in 24:36.</p><p>It may be noted in passing that Divine revelation descends, besides the heart, on the tongue and the ears. In 75:17 we have the words, \"move not thy tongue with this revelation that thou mayest hasten to preserve it,\" which shows that revelation descends on the tongue also. The Holy Prophet is reported to have said: \"Sometimes the angel takes the form of a man and talks to me and I remember what he says\" (Bukhari). This hadith shows that revelation descends on the ears also. But the revelation which descends upon the tongue or the ear descends at the same time on the heart as well.</p>"

                    "note": "<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The advent of the Holy Prophet and the revelation of the Quran both have been foretold in the previous Divine Scriptures. Prophecies to this effect are to be found in the religious scriptures of almost every faith but the Bible, being the best known and most widely read of all revealed Books before the Quran and also being its forerunner and in its pristine purity being its counterpart as a Book of Divine laws, contains the largest number of such prophecies. Here are some of those prophecies:</p><p>(1) I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren; like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him (Deut. 18:18-19).</p><p>(2) And he said, the Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran and he came with ten thousands of saints; from his right hand went a fiery law for them (Deut. 33:2).</p><p>The reference in the above prophecy is to the conquest of Mecca when the Holy Prophet marched into that town at the head of an army of exactly ten thousand Companions, holding the Quran in his right hand.</p><p>(3) And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him (Isaiah 8: 15-17).</p><p>(4) The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge; O ye travelling companies of Dedanim. The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they did meet with their bread him that fled. For they fled from the swords, from the drawn swords, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. For thus hath the Lord said unto me. Within a year. According to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it (Isaiah 21: 13-17).</p><p>The reference in the above prophecy is evidently to Arabia and to the Battle of Badr when the sons of Kedar, the Quraish, suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of Muslims and many of their great fighters and archers were killed.</p><p>(5) And thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name (Isaiah 62: 2).</p><p>The prophecy foretells of a new people bearing a new name which will be given to them by God Himself. There is only one people in the world who have a name given to them by God and they are the Muslims. It is to the fulfilment of this prophecy that the Quranic verse clearly refers, viz. \"He named you Muslims before and in this Book\" (22:79).</p><p>(6) I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun hath scorched me. (Song of Solomon 1: 5-6.)</p><p>How aptly this description applies to the Holy Prophet and the Arabs!</p><p>(7) God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran, Selah. His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise…He stood, and measured the earth: He beheld and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting. I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble (Habakkuk 3: 3-7).</p><p>In this prophecy mention has been made not only of the Holy Prophet but also of the country in which he was to make his appearance and of the great success that was to attend his mission and the military exploits of his Successors. The holy one whose praise filled the earth and who appeared from Paran was none else than Muhammad, the praised one. From his right hand went the fiery Law—the Quran. He measured the earth and drove asunder the nations and before his irresistible armies the mighty and long established empires were scattered like chaff before the wind and his Shari‘ah is to last forever.</p><p>(8) Jesus saith unto them, did ye never read in the scriptures? The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s dong, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder (Matt. 21:42-45).</p><p>After Jesus, the spiritual kingdom was forever taken away from the House of Israel and given to another nation—the Ishmaelites who have brought forth the right fruits thereof. The Holy Prophet was the stone which the builders rejected and which became the head of the corner. The application to him of this prophecy cannot be disputed or doubted.</p><p>(9) I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot hear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you (John 16: 12-14).</p><p>This prophecy too applies to the Holy Prophet of Islam. He was the Comforter and the Spirit of truth. He guided mankind to all truth because he brought the most complete and perfect Law. He glorified Jesus and all other Prophets of God (4:158-160). He did not speak of himself, but whatsoever he heard that did he speak. About him the Quran says: \"Nor does he speak out of desire, it is naught but revelation that is revealed\" (53:4-5).</p>"

Four reasons which have been spread over the present and the next three verses constitute this rebuttal. They are: (1) Those who follow and associate with the poets are men of no high moral character. They are prone to err and stray away from the path of rectitude. But the Holy Prophet brought about a wonderful moral transformation among his followers who became possessed of very noble ideals and very high moral character. (2) The poets have no fixed ideal or programme in life. They, as it were, wander about distractedly in every valley. But the Holy Prophet had a great and sublime mission in life. It was the moral and spiritual regeneration of the depraved Arab society and through them the reformation and resuscitation of the whole degenerate and corrupt humanity. It was given to no woman-born to pursue and achieve a higher and nobler ideal. (3) The poets do not practise what they preach but the Holy Prophet was not only the noblest preceptor but the greatest man of action and a model exemplar also. (4) The poets praise and abuse other people as it suits them and sometimes even make bold to prophesy about the future but never know what their own end would be. But the Holy Prophet, deserted by his own kith and kin and amidst the severest persecution, when all was dark and dismal around him, emphatically declared that he would eventually succeed and he did succeed.</p>"
