Thus \"the Ten Nights\" represent the ten dark years of severe persecution to which Muslims were subjected at Mecca before the Holy Prophet’s Migration to Medina which has been likened to the break of the dawn in the preceding verse. Or \"the Ten Nights\" may refer to the ten centuries of the decline and decadence of Islam before the advent of the Promised Messiah, with which ended a dark period of degradation, and which ushered in the dawn of a glorious future for Islam. An implied reference to these \"Ten Nights\" of the decline of Islam is also to be found in the Quranic verse: \"He will plan the Divine Ordinance from the heavens unto the earth, then shall it go up to Him in a day the duration of which is thousand years according to what you reckon\" (32:6). These ten centuries (or a thousand years) of the moral decadence of Muslims came after the first three centuries of the heyday of their glory and grandeur which have been called the best three centuries of Islam by the Holy Prophet (Bukhari, <i>Kitabur-Riqaq</i>). The decline of Islam began towards the end of the third century A.H. when on the one hand an Umayyad Caliph of Spain signed a pact of mutual assistance with the Pope against the Abbasid Empire of Baghdad and, on the other, the Caliph of Baghdad entered into a treaty of friendship with the Caesar of Rome against the Umayyad Caliph of Spain.</p>"

It was in the Battle of Badr, about one year after the Hijrah, that the Quraish suffered an ignominious defeat and this literally fulfilled Prophet Isaiah’s prophecy: \"For thus hath the Lord said unto me, within a year, according to the years of an hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail.\" (Isa. 21:16) Thus though after the Migration to Medina the 'morning' had dawned for the Muslims, still they were not completely out of the wood; they had to suffer hardships for another night, i.e. a year. Or the verse may signify that after the advent of the Promised Messiah which heralded the break of the Dawn for Islam, its difficulties would not altogether disappear. One night of darkness—one century of difficulties—seems to lie ahead; after which Islam would march forward on a uniform course of success. Thus the <i>Surah</i> embodies a double prophecy which was made at a time when the prospects for Islam appeared to be very bleak indeed. It was remarkably fulfilled first, in the first phase of the chequered career of Islam, and it is at present in the process of being fulfilled in the shape of the renaissance being wrought at the hands of the Promised Messiah, the Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement.</p>"

Similarly, he is caused to be involved in troubles that he may be tried, rewarded or punished according to his actions. But man is so constituted that when he is in ease and affluence, he regards it as the fruit of his labour and superior intelligence (28:79); but when misfortunes overtake him, he attributes them to God. The Quran has treated the question, whether God, or man himself, is the author of his destiny, from different angles. Whereas in 41:47 it says that man himself makes or mars his destiny, in 4:80 it says that good comes from God but evil from man’s ownself, and yet in 4:79 it observes that both good and evil come from God. In fact, as God has created everything for the good of man, and it is by misusing God-given gifts that he involves himself in trouble, good is said to proceed from God and evil from man. But as God produces the results of the good or bad actions of man, good or evil are both said to come from God. And as man is a free agent, both good and evil are attributed to him. Thus these verses explain and support one another, there being no contradiction between them.</p>"

It is given to you that you should spend it to meet the needs of the orphans and the poor, but you squander it in immoral pursuits, depriving others of their rights in it, or else you hoard it and refuse to spend it in noble causes.\" In fact inordinate love of money leads to three inevitable results: (a) It creates in man an excessive desire to keep on adding to his wealth, without spending it on good causes or on meeting the needs of the orphans and the poor. (b) It makes him careless about whether he acquires wealth by fair or by dishonest means. (c) In time of national peril, fear of possible success of the enemy renders his loyalty to his country doubtful. With the desire, in such an eventuality, to keep his life and property safe he does not take an active part in his country’s defence. These are the main causes that lead to the destruction of a people. Islam takes as much care of the moral health of society as it takes of that of the individual; and society’s health requires that material goods be widely distributed and wealth kept in easy circulation.</p>"

He attains the highest stage of spiritual development; \"he is well pleased with his Lord and his Lord is well pleased with him.\" At this stage, called the heavenly stage, man is freed from all weakness and frailty and is braced with a peculiar spiritual strength. He becomes \"united\" with God and cannot exist without Him. As water flows with great force down a slope and, on account of its great mass and the total absence of all obstacles, dashes down with irresistible force, so the God-intoxicated man, at this stage, casting off all trammels, becomes attracted unrestrainedly towards his Maker. It is in this life and not after death that this great transformation takes place in him and it is in this world and not elsewhere that access to Paradise is granted to him. He finds his support only in God; He drinks deep at this fountain of spiritual life and is delivered from death.</p>"
