                    "note": "<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>A brief note here on abbreviated letters which have been placed at the beginning of some <i>Surahs</i> of the Quran and which are known as المقطعات (<i>al</i>-<i>Muqatta‘at)</i> i.e. letters used and pronounced separately, is called for. The <i>Muqatta‘at</i> are abbreviations for specific attributes of God and the subject matter of a <i>Surah</i> before which they are placed has a deep connection with the Divine attributes for which they stand. The various <i>Muqatta‘at</i> have not been haphazardly placed at the beginning of different <i>Surahs</i>, nor are their letters combined arbitrarily. There runs a deep and far-reaching connection between the various sets of <i>Muqatta‘at</i> and the letters of which they are made also serve a definite purpose. <i>Surahs</i> 2 &amp; 3 are prefaced with the abbreviated letters الم (<i>Alif Lam Mim</i>), indicating a kinship between their contents. chapters 4, 5 &amp; 6 have no <i>Muqatta‘at</i> placed at their beginning which means that the subject matter of these three chapters is subordinate to and follows the pattern of that of the preceding two <i>Surahs</i>. Chapter 7 begins with the abbreviated letters المص (<i>Alif Lam Mim Sad</i>) which has the additional letter ص. The next two chapters (8 &amp; 9) have no <i>Muqatta‘at</i> and the following three chapters (10, 11 &amp; 12) have the abbreviated letters الر (<i>Alif Lam Ra</i>) placed at their beginning and the 13th chapter begins with المر (<i>Alif Lam Mim Ra</i>) i.e. with the addition ofم to الر. Chapters 14 and 15 have again the combination الر in their beginning which shows that there exists a certain similarity of subject matter among all these <i>Surahs</i>. Chapters 16, 17 and 18 have no <i>Muqatta‘at</i> before them which again shows that the subject matter of these three <i>Surahs</i> is subordinate and similar to that of the preceding <i>Surahs</i>. Chapter 19 is headed with کھیعص(<i>Kaf Ha Ya‘Ain Sad</i>) and deals with a particular subject, i.e. the Christian dogmas of Salvation and Atonement. The next six <i>Surahs</i> have no abbreviated letters at their beginning, طه at the head of 20th chapter, not being treated as <i>Muqatta‘at.</i> The following three <i>Surahs</i> are known as the <i>Surahs</i> of طس (<i>Ta Sin</i>) group. With the 29th chapter the Quranreverts to the same subject which has already been dealt with in <i>Surahs</i>2 &amp; 3 but in a new form and to fulfil a new need and serve a new purpose, and, therefore, this chapter again has the <i>Muqatta‘at </i>الم (<i>Alif Lam Mim</i>) in its beginning. The next three chapters (30, 31 &amp; 32) follow suit and the five chapters following these <i>Surahs </i>have no <i>Muqatta‘at</i>. Chapter ص (<i>Sad</i>) begins with the abbreviated letter ص (<i>Sad</i>) and the next chapter (39) has no <i>Muqatta‘at</i>.</p><p>The following seven <i>Surahs </i>open with the abbreviated letters حم <i>(Ha Mim</i>), only chapter 42 having the letters عسق(<i>‘Ain Sin Qaf</i>) added to حم (<i>Ha Mim</i>). They are known as <i>Surahs</i> of حم group. The next three <i>Surahs</i>, viz. 47, 48 &amp; 49 again have no <i>Muqatta‘at</i> in their beginning. The 50th chapter is the last chapter which has an abbreviated letter i.e. ق(<i>Qaf</i>).</p><p>This somewhat detailed examination shows that three main categories of <i>Muqatta‘at</i> have been used in the Quran and that the <i>Surahs </i>having the same category of <i>Muqatta‘at</i> have been placed together which is a further indication of the fact that the subjects dealt with in such <i>Surahs </i>bear a close resemblance to each other and that the <i>Muqatta‘at</i> placed in their beginning serve as a key to their subject matter.</p><p>It is also pertinent to note that there is one thing which is common to all those <i>Surahs</i> that have <i>Muqatta‘at</i>. They open with the subject of the revelation of the Quran and this is no mere chance.</p><p>The system of using abbreviations (<i>Muqatta‘at</i>) was in vogue among the Arabs and at present is very popular in western countries and in its imitation in all eastern countries.</p><p>According to Ummi Hani, a cousin of the Holy Prophet, he (the Holy Prophet) is reported to have said that in the combined letters کھیعص the letter ک stands for کاف (the All-Sufficient), ھ for ھاد (the Guide), ع for علیم (the All-Knowing), and ص for صادق (the Truthful). According to Ibn ‘Abbas, however, the letters ک stands for کبیر (the Great), ھ for ھاد (the Guide), ی for امین (Who gives peace and protection), ع forعزیز (the Mighty) and ص for صادق (the Truthful). Ibn Mas‘ud and some other Companions interpreted these combined letters as الملک (theKing), الاله(God), العزیز (the Mighty) and المصور (the Fashioner). ‘Ali sometimes would preface his prayer with the words یا کھیعص(Fath).</p><p>Different combinations of abbreviated letters signify different subjects and the subject matter of a particular <i>Surah</i> at the beginning of which a particular combination is placed is governed by it. It has been explained above that the abbreviated letters stand for Divine attributes, but which particular letter stands for which particular Divine attribute becomes clear only by a deep study of the subject matter of the <i>Surah</i> at the beginning of which those letters are placed. The explanation of کھیعص as given by the Holy Prophet in the hadith narrated by Ummi Hani must necessarily be accepted as the best and should be preferred to all other explanations. But in this explanation the letter ی has been left out which shows that it does not signify any Divine attribute but has been used only as a letter of interjection, joining the first two Divine attributes with the last two. Thus the explanation of the combined abbreviated letters would read like this: انت کاف انت ھاد یا علیم یا صادق i.e. \"Thou art Sufficient for all and Thou art the true Guide, O, All-Knowing, Truthful God.\" Or expanding its sense a little further the expression would mean, \"Thou O God, Who knowest all my secrets and art true to Thy promises and art a true Friend, Thou alone canst satisfy all my needs and Thou alone canst guide me.\"</p><p>The four Divine attributes as represented by the combined letters کھیعص expose the falsity of the basic Christian doctrine of Atonement, i.e. salvation through the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus which forms one of the principal subjects of the <i>Surah</i> under comment. And if the doctrine of Atonement is proved to be false, the whole structure of the doctrines of the Trinity and godhead of Jesus would automatically fall to the ground.</p><p>Of these four attributes عالم or علیم and صادق are the principal and basic attributes and کاف and ھادare subordinate ones and flow from the former two and are their inevitable manifestation and result. If God is عالم (All-Knowing), then there is no place for the dogma of Atonement because this dogma presupposes that God had designed to carry on the business of the world according to a certain plan but His knowledge being defective that plan failed to function and, therefore, God was compelled to offer His own son for sacrifice to save the world. The failure of God’s plan contradicts His attribute \"All-Knowing\" and when God’s knowledge is shown to be defective, He cannot claim to be کاف (All-Sufficient) because the Being Who is عالم (All-Knowing) must necessarily be کاف (All-Sufficient).</p><p>In the same way the attribute صادق (Truthful) and its subordinate attribute ھاد (Guide) demolish this dogma. If God is not the true Guide and salvation without a belief in the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus is impossible, then all Divine Messengers will have to be accepted as so many liars and cheats because, contrary to Christian belief, they preached and taught that salvation was possible only through right beliefs and righteous actions; and a reflection on the truthfulness of God’s Messengers constitutes a reflection on the truthfulness of God Himself and consequently on His being ھاد i.e. the True Guide. Thus in this combination of abbreviated letters a hint is given that in dealing with the beliefs and doctrines of Christians, the best way to drive home to them the untenability of their doctrines is to dwell and lay emphasis upon Divine attributes, particularly on the attributes which are represented by the four letters ک, ھ , ع , ص .</p><p>In fact the best and most effective argument to show that the doctrine of Atonement is entirely unfounded, is to prove that Jesus did not die on the cross and if this thesis is proved, then the question that by his crucifixion he carried away the sins of humanity does not arise. For a detailed and full discussion, however, of the subject that Jesus did not die on the cross but after having remained on it only for a few hours was taken down alive, was kept in a sepulchre and then in fulfilment of his own prophecy, viz. \"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd\" (John 10:16), he travelled to Afghanistan and Kashmir to reclaim and retrieve the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel who had been dispersed to these countries by the Babylonian kings. See 23:51.</p>"

                    "note": "<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The account of Zachariah precedes the account of Jesus. This is due to two very valid reasons. Yahya, the son of Zachariah, and John of the New Testament, was a harbinger of Jesus. He heralded Jesus’ advent and acted as his precursor to give to the Jews the glad tidings that their deliverer was about to make his appearance.</p><p>That Yahya or John was Jesus’ harbinger is apparent from the following prophecy of Prophet Malachi: \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord\" (Mal. 4:5). The words \"the great and dreadful day\" here signify the advent of Jesus. This is why when Jesus was asked where Elias was who was to come before him, he replied: \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come\" (Matt. 11:14). As according to Malachi’s prophecy Elias must have appeared before the coming of Jesus, it was in the fitness of things that while giving an account of Jesus, the Quran should have made a mention of Yahya. Secondly, Mary, the mother of Jesus, had unknowingly become the cause of Yahya’s birth. We are told (3:38, 39) how Zachariah was deeply moved by a pious reply of Mary and prayed to God to be blessed with a good child like her. Thus whereas Yahya became a harbinger of Jesus, Mary, Jesus’ mother having indirectly become the cause of the birth of Yahya may as well be said to have become a precursor of Yahya (John) himself. See also 3:38-42.</p><p>The words, \"Thy Lord\" in the sentence, \"This is an account of the mercy of thy Lord,\" appear to be misplaced because whereas the account given in the following verses is that of the mercy of God shown to Zachariah the words \"Thy Lord\" seem to indicate as if some account is about to be given of God’s mercy to the Holy Prophet. In fact these words signify that the account of Divine mercy to Zachariah does imply a mercy to the Holy Prophet also. Prophet Yahya, as stated above, was a harbinger of Jesus and Jesus was a harbinger of the Holy Prophet. A description of the birth of Yahyafollowed by a somewhat detailed description of Jesus’ birth pointed to the fact that by the introduction of the life accounts of these two Prophets who, in a way, acted as his precursors, the minds of men were being prepared for the acceptance of the Holy Prophet of Islam by an implied reference to the following Biblical prophecies:</p><p>And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee. Behold I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation (Gen. 17:20);</p><p>I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth (Deut. 18:18).</p><p>The pronoun \"thy\" may also possess an oblique but beautiful reference to Mecca, the birth-place of the Holy Prophet. Mecca like Zachariah’s wife was barren. For thousands of years it had not heard the voice of God. Now God’s mercy was about to dawn upon it. The barren valley of Mecca was about to give birth to the greatest of Adam’s sons. To this barrenness of Mecca reference is found in Isaiah 54:1.</p><p>Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.</p>"

Zachariah had understood from Biblical prophecies and heavenly warnings that were administered to the Jews for their repeated rejection of God’s Prophets that prophethood was soon to be transferred from the House of Isaac to that of Ishmael. So he gave vent to his feelings in the form of prayer for the birth of a righteous son.</p>"

A successful prayer should be offered with fervour and in humility. The supplicant should confess his own weakness and helplessness. He should have firm faith in the power of God to accept his prayers. Zachariah’s prayer fulfils all these conditions. He prays to God in words full of extreme pathos. He invokes Divine mercy by referring to his extreme old age and to the barrenness of his wife. He prays fervently and in all humility. He asks for no worldly gains. He prays only for a righteous heir. He felt that righteousness had altogether disappeared from his family and his relations had consigned God to oblivion. He knew that the House of Israel was about to be deprived forever of the boon of prophethood but still he had not despaired of God’s mercy. He hoped that something yet might happen which should save his people and the House of Israel from utter spiritual ruin. He was extremely anxious that the Israelites might not reject the last Israelite Prophet and might still avert the impending wrath of God. This was Zachariah’s wish which he expressed in words full of pathos. He prayed that an heir be born to him who might warn the Israelites to take heed and not to deprive themselves of the light of prophethood by rejecting their own last Prophet. It appears from the Bible that the whole mission of Yahya for whose birth Zachariah had so fervently prayed consisted in preparing the way for Jesus. He says:</p><p>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire (Matt. 3:11).</p><p>Yahya tried his utmost to make the task of Jesus easy and to prepare the Jews to accept him. But his efforts proved vain. He himself was imprisoned and murdered. His people rejected him as well as his great successor, Jesus. They even sought to kill the latter on the cross. Zachariah’s prayer was only partly fulfilled as Divine decree had also to be implemented. So Yahya was born to Zachariah in fulfilment of his prayer but he (Yahya) failed to soften the hearts of his people. They did not believe in Jesus and thus could not avert the wrath of God and became deprived forever of the light of prophethood which was the real object of Zachariah’s prayer. The Divine will prevailed and prophethood became transferred from the House of Israel to that of Ishmael.</p>"

They say سما و سمی الرجل زیداً i.e. he named the man Zaid. سما means, it became high. سموت الیه ببصری means, I raised my eye towards him. سمی means, competitor or contender for superiority, in eminence or glory or excellence; a like or an equal; a namesake of another. ھو سمیک means, he is thy namesake or he is thy equal or like (Aqrab &amp; Lane).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The two words غلام and یحیٰی used in this verse are very significant. The word غلام signifies three periods of one’s life i.e. childhood, youth and middle age. Applied to Yahya or John it embodied a prophecy that he shall not die in childhood but shall grow up to be a young man before the eyes of his father and shall live up to middle age and so it actually came to pass. Yahya lived up to middle age and then was killed by the order of Herod to satisfy the wish of a dancing girl. The word یحییٰ literally meaning, \"he lives\" or \"he shall live,\" also implied a great prophecy, viz. that he will die the death of a martyr and thus will become immortalized. Of the martyrs the Quran says: <i>Say not of those who are killed in the cause of Allah that they are dead; nay they are living; only you perceive not (2:155). Again it says: Think not of those who have been slain in the cause of Allah as dead. Nay, they are living in the presence of their Lord and are granted gifts from Him</i>(3:170). Thus those who are killed in the way of God get everlasting life and so did Yahya or John. His ministry terminated in his imprisonment in the fortress of Machaerus, where he was executed by the order of Herod Antipas (Matt. 14:10 &amp; 11). See also 3:40.</p><p>The words, <i>We have not made anyone before him of that name</i>, do not mean that there had lived before him no man whose name was John. From the Bible it appears that there had been several persons before him who were called John. (II Kings 25:23; I Chronicles 3:15; Ezra 8:12). Nor does the verse mean that John was peerless and was unequalled in every respect. He himself confesses that \"there cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose\" (Mark 1:7). The verse only signifies that in some respects Yahya had no equal, i.e. he enjoyed a partial superiority in some respects over other Israelite Prophets. Abraham, Moses and Jesus were Prophets of much higher spiritual status than John, the Baptist, who had come only to prepare the way for Jesus (Mark 1:3). Yahya was peerless only in this respect that he was the first Prophet to come as a precursor and harbinger to another Prophet—Jesus. And he was peerless in this respect also that he was the first Prophet who came with the power and spirit of another Prophet—Elias.</p>"

In fact, the present verse is an answer to the surprise of Zachariah expressed in the previous verses. Zachariah was promised the birth of a son in his extreme old age. The son was not to be an ordinary one but was to be possessed of great spiritual powers and to be peerless in respect of certain spiritual qualities. So the reference here is to the spiritual birth of Zachariah and to his great moral qualities.</p><p>The word \"he\" in the expression \"he said\", refers to the angel who brought the glad tidings to Zachariah. In verse 8 Zachariah is mentioned as having been addressed by God; in the present verse, however, he is described as having been addressed by one angel while in 3:40 it is stated that several angels called to him. These three statements seem to be mutually contradictory and the critics of Islam like Wherry have not failed to represent this fact as such. But in reality there is no such contradiction. According to the Quran when a Divine revelation of exceptional importance descends upon a Prophet of God, a number of angels, in accordance with the nature of its importance, are made to accompany it for its safeguarding (35:2) but only one angel representing all of them and on their behalf is entrusted with the duty to convey the Divine revelation to the Prophet. Thus the speaking of one angel means the speaking of all of them and therefore to say that one or many angels spoke to a Prophet makes no difference. Similarly, there is no contradiction in the words \"God said\" or \"the angels said\", because angels only speak to a Prophet as God’s representatives and as His servants convey to him the Divine Message.</p>"

In 3:42 the word رمزا has been used to express the same sense, for رمز means to communicate by means of movements of the lips and not to use one’s throat.

                    "note": "<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>During the first few centuries of its life Islam made very rapid progress. Large numbers of people from every religion—especially from Christianity, entered its fold. They brought with them some very erroneous beliefs about Jesus Christ. As they had not imbibed fully the true spirit of Islamic teachings, their false ideas and beliefs subsequently found their way into Muslim religious literature with the result that they came to form part of the beliefs of Muslims. All these beliefs had been invented to invest Jesus with an extraordinary personality—a personality much above human level. It is these foolish beliefs about Jesus that the Quran seeks to demolish in the present <i>Surah</i>. By instituting a comparison between Yahya, who was a Prophet of an ordinary spiritual stature, and Jesus, it means to suggest that there was nothing in Jesus which distinguished him from other Divine Messengers. We give below some of the spiritual qualities and characteristics of both these Prophets as given in the Quran to establish the above fact.</p><p>About Jesus it is said that:</p><p>1. He was a Prophet of God (3:50).</p><p>2. He was of the righteous (3:47).</p><p>3. God taught him the Book and the wisdom (3:49).</p><p>4. He talked to people as a child i.e. in rather early age (3:47).</p><p>5. He was granted nearness to God (3:46).</p><p>6. He was kind and dutiful to his mother (19:33).</p><p>7. He was kind of heart and compassionate (5:119).</p><p>8. He was not haughty and unblessed (19:33).</p><p>9. He was blessed by God and was strengthened with the Spirit of Holiness (2:254; 19:32).</p><p>10. Divine peace enveloped him (19:34).</p><p>11. His name Messiah was given to him by God (3:46).</p><p>About Yahya it is said that:</p><p>1. He was a Prophet (3:40).</p><p>2. He was noble, chaste and a Prophet from among the righteous (3:40).</p><p>3. God gave him the Book and granted him wisdom (19:13).</p><p>4. God gave him wisdom while yet a child (19:13).</p><p>5. God was well pleased with him (19:7).</p><p>6. He was kind and dutiful to his parents (19:15).</p><p>7. He was kind-hearted, pure and pious (19:14).</p><p>8. He was not haughty and rebellious (19:15).</p><p>9. God was pleased with him and he was unequalled in some respects (19:7-8).</p><p>10. Divine peace enveloped him (19:16).</p><p>11. His name Yahya was given to him by God (19:8).</p><p>By instituting this comparison we should not be understood to mean that Jesus and John were of absolutely equal spiritual standing and there was nothing to distinguish one from the other. Jesus did indeed possess a higher spiritual status than John. What the Quran wants to make clear is the fact that there was nothing in Jesus which should raise him to the pedestal of Divinity. He was no doubt a great Prophet of God and was immune from sin but so were all other Divine Messengers, John being one of them. About him Jesus says: \"For I say unto you, among those that are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John, the Baptist\" (Luke 7:28).</p><p>The verse should not be understood to signify that Prophet Yahya was not murdered but died a natural death, a view mistakenly held in certain quarters, because it runs counter to an established fact of history. The words \"peace was on him\" used in the verse seem to have given rise to this manifestly wrong view but they lend no support to it. The word \"peace\" has not been used in a physical but a spiritual sense. In fact the verse refers to three periods or states of man’s life. The first state begins with his birth and ends with his death. The second state which is called برزخ (<i>Barzakh</i>), literally meaning 'the period of earning merit or demerit is over', commences with death and continues till doom. The third state has been called \"The Day of Resurrection\" in the Quran. It is the day of the complete manifestation of God’s glory. It is these three states or periods of man’s existence to which the present verse refers and in all of which, it says, Yahya will enjoy spiritual peace.</p>"

                    "note": "<p><strong>Important Words:</strong></p><p>مریم (Mary) is probably a compound word consisting of مر and یم and possesses, in Hebrew, a variety of meanings. Some of these meanings are: 'bitter sea'; 'drop of the sea'; 'star of the sea'; 'bitterness'; 'mistress or lady'. The word also means 'exalted'. It may also mean 'pious worshipper'. From two alternative roots the word might also mean, 'the rebellious', or 'the corpulent'. It seems that among the Jews and the Arabs corpulence was considered as a mark of beauty and girls who were corpulent were considered beautiful and therefore named Maryam. Maryam also seems to be a popular name among the Jews in the time of Jesus. See also 3:37.</p><p>شرقیاً (to the east) means, (1) facing the east; (2) to the east. مکاناً شرقیاً means, a place to the east; a place facing the east; a place in which the sun shines; an open dwelling place (Lane).</p><p>الکتاب (the Book) may refer both to the Bible and the Quran.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>It seems relevant and necessary to mention, as a prelude to the somewhat detailed account of Jesus’ fatherless birth as given in the next several verses, some facts related about Mary in the Quran and the Bible.</p><p>The New Testament sheds practically no light on the life of Mary before she became pregnant. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke give an extremely brief and discursive description of her circumstances before the above important event took place while Mark and John are completely silent over it. According to Matthew, Mary, on being married to Joseph, was found to be with a child. Joseph intended secretly to put her away but was refrained from taking this extreme step by an angel saying to him in a dream: \"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife\" (Matt. 1:19, 20). According to Luke, Mary was a relation of Zachariah’s wife and used to go to their house. Apart from this unimportant additional fact Luke leaves us quite in the dark about Mary’s account prior to her marriage with Joseph. But the Quran gives us a much more detailed account of Mary’s family, the circumstances that attended her birth, the vow of her mother, her childhood being dedicated to the service of the Church and lastly of her having conceived Jesus (3:36-38).</p><p>The present <i>Surah</i>, however, gives a still more detailed account of Mary having conceived Jesus and of what happened to her and to Jesus after his birth and after he was commissioned with his divine mission. The Quran has provided us with all necessary details about Mary that have any bearing on the important subject of prophethood which was about to be transferred from the House of Israel to that of Ishmael and which forms the principal thesis of the present <i>Surah</i>. If anything the Bible has given a very sorry picture of Jesus and his relations with his mother. Whereas the Quran depicts him to be kind, dutiful and very compassionate towards his mother, the Gospels show that he did not like his mother because she did not believe in him (Matt. 12:46-50). Mark 3:31-35 and Luke 8:19-21 show that besides Mary, Jesus’ other relations did not believe in him while the Gospel of John keeps discreetly silent over this painful subject. We also know that the Jews used to taunt Jesus by saying that if his mission was true why his own relations did not believe in him (Matt. 13:55-56). Some of his relations and friends went so far as to lay hold on him for they said that he was beside himself (Mark 3:21). This attitude of disbelief on the part of his relatives towards Jesus had made him so bitter that when he was being taken to Calvary to be put on the cross and his mother appeared on the scene, he addressed her saying 'Woman, behold thy son!' (John 19:26). And when on another occasion a woman being very much impressed by his discourse said: 'Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked' (Luke 11:27), he retorted: 'Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it' (Luke 11:28), which signified that he could not even bear his mother being praised.</p><p>Such is the picture which the Gospels have drawn of the unenviable relations between Jesus and his mother. But the description is not only self-contradictory, it also offends against human nature and intelligence. The Quran, however, presents both these blessed and holy persons in quite a different light. Regarding Jesus it says that he was kind and loving, obedient and dutiful to his mother and that he was not haughty and rude (19:33) while about Mary it states that she was a pious, chaste and truthful woman and was a great worshipper of God and that God purified her, accepted her and chose her above the women of the world (3:43, 44; 5:76; 66:13). How great is the difference between the unenviable picture of Mary drawn by the Gospels and the beautiful description given of her in the Quran. Whereas the Biblical description is highly derogatory and self-contradictory, the Quranic description is not only consistent with the dignity of a highly righteous woman but is also more akin to truth and facts of history.</p><p>As the verse shows Mary withdrew herself to a place to the east. Special mention has been made of \"a place to the east\" in the verse, in order, perhaps, to point to the time-honoured custom of the Jews that they attached special significance to مشرق (east) and considered it sacred. They believed that the birth of the first man took place in the east where God planted a garden (Gen. 2:8). The Babylonians by whose traditions the Jews became much impressed as they had lived under them as captives also looked upon the east as \"the gate of light\" (Ezekiel 11:1). Matthew 2:2 and Revelation 7:2 also shed some light on the importance of the east. Both the Jews and Christians hold the east in special respect. They build their places of worship facing the east. This is why special mention has been made in the present verse \"of a place to the East\" and Mary has been described as having gone to \"a place which was facing the east.\"</p><p>For a somewhat detailed note on the early life of Mary see vv. 3:36, 37, 38.</p>"

For the different meanings of the word روح see 2:88; 4:172 &amp; 16:3.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The expression فتمثل لھا بشرا سویا signifies that the Divine glad tidings about the birth of a great son was conveyed to Mary not in the form of spoken words which she could hear or which flowed from her mouth. The revelation to her took the form of a dream or vision. She saw in a vision that an angel came to her in the form of a healthy man and conveyed to her the Divine Message about the birth of a son. In fact, it is the Word of God which at the time of revelation takes different forms and which when it came to Mary took the form of a man appearing in a dream. So it was no spirit that had entered Mary’s body. The vision was but a manifestation of God’s great power.</p><p>Christians try to derive a false satisfaction from the words روحنا alleging that according to the Quran, the Divine Spirit or God Himself had entered Mary’s body and that as a result thereof she became pregnant and therefore Jesus who was born as the result of that conception was the son of God. The Quran lends no support whatsoever to this blasphemous and preposterous dogma but condemns and denounces it in the strongest possible terms (5:73-74; 19:89-91). What the verse says is only this that an angel of God (روح means an angel) appeared to Mary in a vision in the form of a man and gave to her the glad tidings of the birth of a son.</p><p>Even the Gospels repudiate this fantastic dogma. According to them Mary had conceived only of the Holy Ghost (Matt. 1:18-20; Luke, l:35). Thus according to Christians’ own admission Jesus, at best, was the son of the Holy Ghost. But if they believe that he was the son of God then they shall also have to admit that the Holy Ghost is God. But they accept neither of these propositions. So whereas the Quran strongly condemns and denounces the Christian dogma of sonship of Jesus, the Gospels too do not support it. What the Quran says is simply this that an angel appeared before Mary in the form of a man and gave her from God the glad tidings of the birth of a great son.</p>"

As is apparent from the previous verse it was a mere vision that Mary had seen, and it generally happens that when a person sees a thing in a vision which he does not like in his waking state, he does not like it when he sees it in a vision. When Mary saw the angel standing before her in the form of a man she, being a virtuous young woman, was naturally frightened and perplexed as she would have been frightened and perplexed if she had seen him in her state of wakefulness and it is therefore quite natural that she sought Divine protection from him.</p>"

Sometimes his feelings and talk in the dream are subject to and under the effect of the dream that he sees while at another time they are not, and he feels and talks as he would feel and talk if he were awake. For example, if in a dream a person is glad over the death of his son, his feelings will be regarded as under the effect of the dream because in his state of wakefulness no sane person would be glad over the death of his son. So if the words spoken by Mary when she saw the angel in her vision were under the effect of the vision, then they would signify that when the glad tidings were given to her about the birth of a son she had a pleasant surprise whether God would work such a miracle as to give her—a virgin—a son. But if the words be regarded as a natural expression on her part when the tidings of the birth of a son were given to her then they would signify that she was completely perplexed and horror-struck at the thought that a son should be born to her—a virgin. In the former case hers would be a very pleasant surprise at the great favour that God was going to do her and in the latter case it would be an expression of bewilderment indicating the horrified state of her mind.</p><p>The words 'no man has touched me' show that Mary thought that the glad tidings about the birth of a son to her meant that the child would be born to her without contracting a regular marriage, otherwise there was no sense in her denying having known any man. The words, 'neither have I been unchaste' show that whereas in the previous clause she had denied having known any man lawfully i.e. in a married state, these words refer to her denial of having known any person unlawfully i.e. outside legal wedlock. In her reply to the angel she seemed to be thinking of the circumstances of her life in the Temple and of her vow of celibacy which obviated the possibility of her having any offspring. If she thought that the promise made in the preceding verse referred to the birth of a son as a result of her conjugal relations in some future time, as some commentators of the Quran think, then there was no occasion for her to express any surprise.</p>"

See also 15:67.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The words, <i>It is easy for Me</i>, signify that a most unusual and apparently impossible thing such as to cause a child to be born without the instrumentality of a father is quite easy for God to bring about. The expression, <i>that We may make him a Sign unto men</i>, implies the fatherless birth of Jesus. That birth was indeed a great Sign for the Israelites. It pointed to the impending transition of prophethood from the House of Israel to that of Ishmael. It also constituted a warning to the Israelites in the sense that they had become spiritually so corrupt and morally so degenerate that no male among them was fit enough to become the father of a Prophet of God. So God decreed to bring about Jesus’ birth independently of a father. Jesus had an Israelite mother only and had no father. As the final step in the process of transition, however, the Great and Noble Messenger who was to follow him was to have neither an Israelite father nor an Israelite mother. He was to appear from another people, from among the Ishmaelites, the brethren of the Israelites, in accordance with the Divine promise made to Moses (Deut. 18:18). It is in this sense that Jesus has been spoken of as 'a Sign of the Hour' in the Quran (43:62), i.e. a Sign of the time when prophethood was to have passed from the Israelites to the Ishmaelites. See also Introduction to this <i>Surah</i>.</p><p>Jesus has also been spoken of 'as a mercy from Us.' He was a mercy from God in the sense that he taught meekness and humility to the Jews who had become hard-hearted and conceited to the core. He was also a mercy in the sense that he came as a forerunner of the Holy Prophet who himself 'was sent as a mercy for all the worlds' (21:108). Again Jesus was a divine mercy inasmuch as he paved the way for the revelation of the Quran which has also been referred to as 'a mercy from the Lord' (29:52; 43:33). But this use of the words, 'That We may make him a Sign unto men and a mercy from Us' should not be understood to entitle Jesus to any special spiritual status. Other persons and prophets of God have also been styled 'as a mercy and a Sign from God' in the Quran (2:260; 7:74; 10:93; 21:108).</p><p>The expression, <i>and it is a thing decreed</i>, means that God had decreed that a fatherless son would be born to Mary and that this Divine decree was irrevocable. The Quran has used two words قدر and قضا to express the sense of Divine decree. They are sometimes erroneously taken one for the other. But while قدر means designing or determining, قضی means decreeing. When a scheme or plan is only designed to be put into execution, it is called قدر but when it is decreed by God that it should be carried into actual effect, it is named قضاء. The fatherless birth of Jesus was a قضاء (Divine decree) of God and not a قدر.</p>"

It may be regarded as above the ordinary natural law as we now know it. But the knowledge of man, at best, is limited. He has not been able to comprehend all divine secrets. There are mysteries in nature which man has not been able to solve as yet; perhaps he may never be able to solve them. Among them may be included the fatherless birth of Jesus. God’s ways are inscrutable and His powers limitless. He Who could create the whole universe by uttering the word, کن (be), surely can bring about such changes in matter as should make this apparently insoluble mystery yield to a solution.</p><p>Medical science, however, has not altogether ruled out the possibility, from a purely biological standpoint, under certain conditions, of natural parthenogenesis or the production of a child by a female without any relation to a male. Medical practitioners call attention to this possibility as a result of a certain type of tumour, which is occasionally found in the female pelvis or lower body. Such tumours which are known as arrhenoblastoma are capable of generating male sperm cells. If living male sperm-cells are produced in a female body by arrhenoblastoma the possibility of self-fertilization of a woman, even though virgin, cannot be denied. That is to say, her own body would produce the same result as though sperm-cells from a man’s body had been transferred to hers in the usual way, or by a physician’s aid. Recently a group of gynaecologists in Europe have published data to prove instances of childbirth where the mother had had no contact with a male (Lancet). For a detailed note on parthenogenesis see 3:48.</p><p>Jesus’ birth is perhaps not altogether unique in this respect that he was born without the agency of a human father. Cases are on record of children having been born without fathers for which see Enc. Brit. under \"Virgin Birth\" and \"Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine\" published by W. B. Saunders &amp; Co., London.</p><p>If we dismiss all these possibilities, then Jesus’ birth will have to be regarded, God forbid, as illegitimate. Christians and Jews are both agreed that the birth of Jesus was something out of the ordinary—the Christians holding it as supernatural and the Jews as illegitimate (Jew. Enc.). Even in the family birth register, the birth of Jesus was recorded as such (Talmud). This fact alone should constitute a valid proof of Jesus’ birth being out of the ordinary. Joseph, Mary’s husband, according to the Gospels, had not established conjugal relations with her till after the birth of Jesus (Matt. 1:25). So the words, 'she conceived him', refer to this extraordinary conception of Mary without the agency of any man.</p><p>The words, 'a remote place', refer to Bethlehem which is about seventy miles south of Nazareth. There Joseph took Mary sometime before Jesus’ birth which took place in that town.</p>"

The word also signifies the low, base, vile or ignoble or depressed persons. The Holy Prophet is reported to have said, لا تقوم الساعة حتی تظھر التحوت و تھلک الوعول i.e. the hour of resurrection will not come until the low or depressed people prevail and the rich and high-placed persons perish; or as some say, until the treasures that are beneath the earth appear (Lane &amp;Taj).</p><p>The word تحت meaning beneath, below and also the slope and declivity of a mountain (Lane), the verse signifies that the voice came to Mary from the side of the slope of the mountain where the fountain was and not from beneath her own body as is popularly believed. As a matter of fact Bethlehem is situated on a rock 2350 ft. above sea-level and is surrounded by very fertile valleys. There are fountains in this rock, one of which is known as the 'fountain of Solomon'. Another fountain is situated at a distance of about 800 yards to the southeast of the town. From these fountains water is supplied to the town of Bethlehem. The words of the verse only mean that the angel called to Mary from the side of the fountain which was situated in the slope (تحت) of the mountain.</p><p>Mary stood in need of water for drinking and for washing herself and the swaddling-clothes. So the voice of the angel indicated to her the direction where the fountain lay. One of the fountains was flowing at a distance of about 800 yards to the south-east of Bethlehem and Joseph and Mary, we are told, finding no accommodation in the town had to lie in the open field at some distance from the town.</p><p>The verse seems to point to a beautiful likeness which Jesus had with another Prophet of God—Ishmael. We are told that when Ishmael suffered from extreme pangs of thirst in the wilderness of Mecca and his mother Hagar in vain searched for water, the voice of the angel came to her saying that God had caused a fountain of water to flow from under the feet of Ishmael (Bukhari). The verse thus entitles Jesus to no particular distinction. Apart from the fatherless birth of Jesus the significance of which has been fully explained in the Introduction to the present <i>Surah</i>, Jesus possesses no distinction. He was only one of so many Divine Messengers.</p>"

That season evidently is in the months of August and September but according to the view generally accepted by Christians, Jesus was born on 25th December which day is celebrated all over the Christian world every year with great fervour. Now this Christian view is contradicted not only by the Quran but also by history and even by writers of the New Testament itself. Writing about the time of Jesus’ birth Luke says: \"And there were shepherds in the same country (Judaea) abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flocks (Luke 2:7, 8). Commenting on this statement of Luke Bishop Barns in his book, <i>Rise of Christianity</i>, on page 79 says: \"There is, moreover, no authority for the belief that December 25 was the actual birthday of Jesus. If we can give any credence to the birth-story of Luke, with the shepherds keeping watch by night in the fields near Bethlehem, the birth of Jesus did not take place in winter, when the night temperature is so low in the hill country of Judaea that snow is not uncommon. After much argument our Christmas day seems to have been accepted about A.D. 300\". This view of Bishop Barns is supported by writers of the articles on \"Christmas\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica and Chambers Encyclopaedia. In Encyclopaedia Britannica we have:</p><p>The exact day and year of Christ’s birth have never been satisfactorily settled; but then the fathers of the Church in A.D. 340 decided upon a date to celebrate the event, they wisely chose the day of the winter solstice which was firmly fixed in the minds of the people and which was their most important festival. Owing to changes in man-made calendars, the time of the solstice and the date of Christmas day vary by a few days (15th edition, vol. 5, pp. 642 &amp; 642A).</p><p>Chambers Encyclopaedia says: In the second place the winter solstice was regarded as the birthday of the sun, and at Rome 25th December was observed as a pagan festival of the nativity of Sol-invictus. The Church, unable to stamp out this popular festival, spiritualized it as the feast of the Nativity of the Sun of Righteousness.</p><p>These statements of the two Encyclopaedias are further supported by Peake’s \"Commentary on the Bible\". In this book on page 727 Peake says: \"The season (of Jesus’ birth) would not be December; our Christmas day is a comparatively late tradition found first in the West.\" Thus recent historical research into the origins of Christianity has established the fact beyond any reasonable doubt that Jesus was not born in December.</p><p>How in the light of historical research into the origins of Christianity and Luke’s statement that Jesus was born at a time when \"there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night\" (Luke 2:7-8) the belief ever came to be entertained by Christians that Jesus was born in December, seems very surprising indeed. According to this statement of Luke, Jesus certainly was born in summer when shepherds abide in the field in Judaea, keeping watch over their flocks at night which is only possible in summer. The incident referred to in Luke very probably took place in the month of August or September when fresh dates are found on palm-trees in Judaea. This is the time when according to the Quranic verse under comment Jesus was born and when his mother Mary was directed by God to \"shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree; it will cause fresh dates to fall upon thee\". Thus the Gospel of Luke inadvertently has lent wonderful support to the Quranic view about the birth of Jesus having taken place in the month of August or September which is the season of fresh ripe dates in Judaea. Moreover, there is ample and very reliable historical evidence also to show that Jesus was born in the month of August or September. In his \"Dictionary of the Bible\" Dr. John D. Davis, under the word \"year\" writes that dates become ripe in the Jewish month of Elul; and in Peake’s \"Commentary on the Bible\" (page 117) we have that the month of Elul corresponds to the months of August-September. Furthermore Dr. Peake says, \"J. Stewart (<i>When did our Lord actually live?</i>) arguing from an Angora temple inscription and a quotation in an old Chinese classic which speaks of the Gospel story reaching China A.D. 25-28 puts the birth of Jesus in 8 B.C. (Sept. or Oct.) and the crucifixion on Wednesday in A.D. 24.\"</p><p>From the above statements of the two Encyclopaedias supported by quotations from the \"Commentary on the Bible\" by Dr. Arthur S. Peake, M.A., D.D., the fact becomes quite clear that Jesus was born in the Jewish month of Elul which corresponds to the months of August-September when dates ripen in Judaea, and not on 25th December as the Christian Church would have us believe. And that is the view expressed by the Quran.</p><p>One more fact in this connection demands careful examination. Sometime before Jesus’ birth Joseph had taken Mary to Bethlehem, a town about seventy miles to the south of Nazareth, the native place of Joseph and Mary. Luke states that Joseph did so because with Quirinius as governor of Syria, Augustus Caesar had ordered that all should go to Bethlehem to be enrolled in the city of David (Luke 2:1-4). But history does not support this statement of Luke. No census was ever taken in the year of Jesus’ birth nor was there any governor of Syria of this name at that time. According to Josephus, one of the greatest of all Jewish historians, the first census ever to be taken was held seven years after Jesus’ birth and the governors of Syria ten years before his birth till Herod’s death were Stiplus Wardus, Sentiris and Titnis (Enc. Brit. under \"Chronicle\").</p><p>It seems incredible that in the face of such reliable historical evidence Luke should have invented this story of the census. There must have been some very compelling reasons for him to do so. It appears that in a desperate search for an excuse to explain why Joseph and Mary undertook such a long and arduous journey to Bethlehem in the latter’s extremely weak state of health and her pregnancy, Luke seems to have stumbled over the fact of a census having taken place in that town which, in fact, had been held seven years after the date that he has assigned to it. He deliberately predated the census by seven years in order to show that both the events—the census and Jesus’ birth, took place at the same time. Writing history about seventy or eighty years after the actual event he perhaps thought that this historical anachronism would not be detected after such a long time. Thus by placing the census, which had occurred seven years later, in the year of Jesus’ birth Luke persuaded himself to believe that he had succeeded in explaining away the fact as to why Joseph had exposed his ailing wife to the rigours of a long and hard journey to Bethlehem in the advanced state of her pregnancy.</p><p>But the difficulty still remains that if, as history shows, there had been no census at the time of Jesus’ birth, then why Luke was so anxious to invent the whole story of the journey to Bethlehem and why it was undertaken. In fact the difficulty was of Luke’s own creation. It was this, that while narrating the account of the immaculate conception of Mary he had stated that great and wonderful miracles had begun and had continued to appear till Jesus’ birth. He feared that if no valid reason were given of this journey of Joseph and Mary, then they would be legitimately accused of being weak of faith and people would naturally say that after having witnessed so many miracles at the time of the conception they were still afraid of public criticism and scandal-mongering and that in order to hide the fact of conception and later birth they had left Nazareth. But the hard reality was there that they had undertaken the journey to Bethlehem, a far-off place. Luke probably thought that people would rightly ask that if immediately after the conception miracles and Divine signs had really begun to appear, then where was the necessity for Joseph to conceal Mary’s pregnancy and the subsequent birth of Jesus, and if there existed no such necessity why did Joseph and Mary undertake that hard and fatiguing journey in the state of her extremely delicate health? Thus the invention of great miracles having taken place at the time of the conception forced Luke to forge the event of the census and also the story that he had undertaken the journey to Bethlehem in order to attend it. But he need not have invented or predated the fact of the census. The whole thing was quite simple and could have been easily explained. Luke could easily have written that Mary had miraculously conceived a child while in the temple and was afterwards married to Joseph who himself was quite convinced of her chastity as he had seen a vision to that effect (see 3:47). But because he feared that he would not be able to convince others of this fact, and because he was afraid of scandal-mongering on the part of the people, therefore, he had to take Mary to a far off place before her pregnancy had become too patent to be concealed any longer. But this he would not do because in that case the whole story of great miracles having attended Mary’s conception would have gone to pieces. This is how the whole difficulty arose and one invention led to another.</p><p>It may be added here that the whole-trouble of fixing the date of Jesus’ birth seems to have arisen from a confusion of the date of Mary’s conception. The pregnancy of Mary seemed to have taken place sometime in November or December and not in March or April as the Church historians would have us believe. When after four or five months’ conception, pregnancy became too obvious to be concealed any longer, Joseph was prevailed upon to take Mary to his house in the month of March or April of the next year. Thus Christian historians mistake the date when Joseph took Mary to his house for the date of her actual conception which had taken place four or five months earlier. As recent research into the origins of Christianity has proved that Jesus was not born in December but in August-September, therefore the conception could not have taken place in March or April. So the Quranic view that Jesus was born in August or September is based not only on historical facts but is also quite in accordance with Luke’s own narrative and therefore is the only safe and sensible conclusion.</p><p>It also appears from the present verse that Mary was lying in a sheltered place in the upper part of the hill and the date-palm was standing on the slope and therefore she could easily reach to its trunk and shake it. That the territory of Bethlehem abounded in date-palms is clear from the Bible (Judges 1:16) and from \"A Dictionary of the Bible\" by Dr. John D. Davis, D. D.</p><p>Moreover, the fact of Mary having been guided to a fountain, as mentioned in the preceding verse, in order to drink of its water and wash herself, points to Jesus’ birth having taken place in the month of August or September because in the icy cold weather of Judaea in December Mary could not have washed herself in the open.</p>"

But this is an obvious misconception. The verse, in fact, refers to the time when Jesus had attained to prophethood as is clear from vv. 31-34 wherein he says, <i>I am a servant of Allah, He has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet;…and has enjoined upon me Prayer and alms-giving so long as I live.</i> Surely Jesus was not made a Prophet in his childhood, nor did he say his Prayers and give Zakah at that time. It appears from the Gospels that after Jesus’ birth at Bethlehem, in pursuance of a Divine command Joseph had taken him and Mary to Egypt where they lived for some years and it was after the death of Herod that the family came back to Nazareth and dwelt there (Matt. 2:13-23). There was also a Biblical prophecy to the effect that Jesus would come to his people along with his mother riding an ass (Matt. 21:4-7). Jesus and Mary were actually riding asses when they entered Jerusalem. Thus the expression تحمله (carrying him or mounting him) may possibly refer to that prophecy of the Bible.</p><p>Moreover the expression حمله as shown under \"Important Words\" above, also means, he helped him and assisted him in his work.</p><p>According to this signification of the word حملthe verse under comment would mean that Mary came to her people with Jesus while she believed in him and helped him in his mission. The expression serves a twofold purpose. On the one hand it refers to the fulfilment of the Biblical prophecy (Matt. 21:4-7) and on the other disposes of the accusation (also contained in the Bible) that Jesus’ brothers and his mother did not believe in him. In any case this verse does not refer to the childhood of Jesus but to the time when prophethood had already been bestowed upon him and he had begun addressing his Message to his people.</p><p>The manner of expression adopted in regard to the birth and prophethood of Jesus is quite like that adopted about John (Yahya) in verses 12 and 13of the present <i>Surah</i>. Verse 12 relates to Zachariah having received the happy news of the birth of a son and v. 13 to the period when his son Yahya had become a Prophet, the remaining incidents in Yahya’s life having been omitted because the Quran is not a book of history that it should give the complete picture of the life of a man. In the same way the preceding three verses give a brief description of Jesus’ birth and the present verse comes straight to the time when he had become a Prophet of God. The fact that v. 23 speaks of Mary having withdrawn to a remote place also belies the inference that she had come from that remote place carrying Jesus in her arms.</p><p>The words, 'thou hast done a strange thing' contain a double taunt. They refer to the calumny of Mary having given birth to an illegitimate son and to Jesus having falsely laid claim to prophethood. As shown under \"Important Words\" above the word فری also means a forger of lies. Thus by using this word the elders of the Jewish people called Mary a bad woman and Jesus a forger of lies and a false Prophet.</p>"

Instead of regretting their own ignorance they have blamed theQuran of ignorance. The question of Mary having been called the sister of Aaron in the Quran was put before the Holy Prophet himself and he told the questioner whether he did not know that the Israelites used to name their children after their Prophets and saints (Bayan, vol. 6, p. 16; Jarir vol. 16, p. 52).</p><p>Mary has been here called the sister of Aaron and not that of Moses though both were brothers, for whereas Moses was the founder of the Jewish Law, Aaron was the head of the Jewish priestly class (Enc. Bib. &amp; Enc. Brit. under \"Aaron\") and Mary also belonged to the priestly order. Tabari has related an incident from the life of the Holy Prophet which gives us an insight into the meanings of the Arabic words اب(<i>ab</i>), عم (‘<i>amm</i>),اخت (<i>ukht</i>) etc. When once Safiyyah, the Holy Prophet’s wife, and incidentally a Jewess by descent, complained to the Holy Prophet that some of his other wives had called her a Jewess in contempt, the Prophet told her to return the taunt by saying that Aaron was her father, Moses her uncle and Muhammad her husband. Surely, the Holy Prophet knew that Aaron was not Safiyyah’s father nor Moses her uncle. This tradition shows that the application of these Arabic words is by no means confined to the above-mentioned blood relations.</p><p>Mary might have been called a sister of Aaron by way of reproach or taunt inasmuch as another Mary, the real sister of Aaron and Moses’ stepsister or his sister-in-law, had charged him (Moses) with having unlawfully married a woman (Numbers 12:1). A reference to this accusation is also to be found in the Quran in 33:70. Thus the elders of the Jews, by calling Jesus’ mother sister of Aaron, meant that as Mary, the sister of Aaron had, by accusing Moses of unlawfully marrying a woman, committed a heinous crime, so did she, like her namesake, commit a heinous act of giving birth to an illegitimate child. See also 3:36.</p>"

These words may also indicate that Mary knew that if she declared herself innocent nobody would believe her. The only evidence of her innocence was her son. She meant that such a holy and righteous son whom God had endowed with such noble qualities could not be the result of an immoral union and that his virtues and good qualities by themselves constituted a sufficient vindication of her innocence. So she pointed to him. The words may also signify that when the Jews accused Mary of adultery she felt embarrassed and pointed to Jesus who had by that time become a Prophet. Some Muslim commentators of the Quran seem to feel a peculiar delight in attributing all sorts of miracles to Jesus. By their misguided reverence for him they have virtually raised him to the pedestal of Divinity. In the words, <i>How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle</i>, they seem to have discovered one such miracle of Jesus. Among all men, even among all the great Prophets of God he alone, they say, could talk while yet a child in the cradle. But the talk which he gave to the elders of the Jews and which is contained in the next four verses (vv.31-34) could not possibly be the talk of a child and if it was, then the facts described therein were a tissue of lies. Jesus says:(a) \"God has made me a Prophet\"; (b) \"He has given me the Book\"; (c) \"He has enjoined me to say Prayers and give the Zakah\"; (d) \"He has made me dutiful to my mother and has not made me haughty\", and (e) \"Peace was on me the day I was born, and peace there will be on me the day I shall die, and the day I shall be raised up to life again.\" All these affirmations from the lips of a baby sound like so many lies and who would call these lies a miracle? Jesus was neither a Prophet at that time, nor did he say Prayer or give Zakah or was given a Book. Moreover, these commentators appear to ignore the quite obvious fact that at another place in the Quran (3:47) this miracle is stated as having consisted in Jesus’ speaking to the people in the cradle and when of middle age (فی المھد وکھلاً). But talk by a man when he is کھل i.e. of middle age, is no miracle; and by joining the word مھد (cradle) with the word کھل (of middle age), the Quran implies that the talk of Jesus in مھدand when he was کھل (of middle age) was no miracle in the sense in which it is understood by the commentators, but it was a miracle in the sense that he spoke words of exceptional wisdom and intelligence in childhood as well as in middle age. The joining of these two words also implied a prophecy that Jesus would not die young but would live up to a good ripe age. This prophecy did constitute a real miracle. But if the word مھدwere to be taken in the sense of \"period of preparation\" which is also one of the meanings of this word, the verse یکلم الناس فی المھد و کھلاً (3:47) would mean that he would speak to people words full of extraordinary wisdom and spiritual knowledge much beyond his years and experience, both in the period of preparation which is youth and in his middle age. Thus the words, <i>How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle</i>, present no difficulty. When Mary, on being taunted by the elders of the Jews, directed their attention to Jesus, they disdained to talk to him and contemptuously said, how could they talk to \"a child in the cradle\" i.e. a mere boy, who was born and brought up before their very eyes. Old and learned people are wont to talk like that when invited to learn wisdom from one who is much younger to them in age. The words merely constitute an expression of contempt and disdain for Jesus. See also 3:47.</p>"

                    "note": "<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The present and the preceding two verses refer to a period when Jesus had already become invested with prophethood. It is an insult to human intelligence and common sense and to belie facts of history and also to betray one’s utter lack of knowledge of the Quranic style and Arabic idiom to say that the words of vv. 31-33 were spoken by Jesus while he was yet a child and therefore constituted a great miracle. A mere babe who sucked the breast of his mother could not say that he was a most obedient and faithful servant of God or that God had given him a Book or that he said Prayers and gave alms or that he was dutiful to his mother and was not haughty. All this talk seems to be a tissue of lies. Jesus could not and did not do any of these things while yet a baby but rather when he had attained to prophethood. It may be argued that the miracle consisted in the fact that Jesus could talk while yet a baby in the cradle but this purpose could equally have been served by his speaking only a few words. If only he had rebuked the elders of the Jews for calumniating his mother in a single sentence they would surely have been taken aback and completely confounded and the purpose of the miracle would have been fully served. But where was the necessity of putting a long discourse in Jesus’ mouth which was not true? The truth is that the miracle did not lie in the supposed infantile talk of Jesus but in the imagination of the commentators themselves.</p><p>In this and the preceding two verses Jesus has been described as saying that (1) he is a servant of God; (2) God has given him the Book; (3) He has made him a Prophet; (4) He has made him blessed; (5) He has enjoined upon him Prayer and alms-giving; (6) He has made him dutiful to his mother and that (7) He has not made him haughty and unblessed. All these words put in Jesus’ mouth by the Quran have been amply supported and corroborated by the Bible:</p><p>(1) As regards Jesus’ being a humble servant of God, subject to human weaknesses and frailties and to the demands and calls of nature and not being God or Son of God, the Bible says:</p><p>And when he had fasted forty days and nights, he afterwards hungered (Matt. 4:2).</p><p>But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, –but the father (Mark 13: 32).</p><p>And Jesus said unto him, why callest thou me good? None is good save one, <i>that is</i> God (Mark 10: 18).</p><p>(2) About the fact that Jesus was given a Book which he followed and taught, the Bible says:</p><p>Think not that I come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled (Matt. 5:17, 18).</p><p>(3) The Bible also supports the Quranic statement that Jesus was only a Prophet of God and not God or the Son of God. It says:</p><p>And He that sent me is with me (John 8: 29).</p><p>Neither came I of myself, but He sent me (John 8: 42).</p><p>He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, (Isaiah 61: 1-3; Luke 4: 15-22).</p><p>And the multitudes said, This is the Prophet, Jesus, of Nazareth of Galilee (Matt. 21:11).</p><p>(4) About Jesus’ being blessed the Bible depicts Elizabeth, the mother of John, as saying to Mary, the mother of Jesus:</p><p>Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb (Luke 1: 42).</p><p>And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him, blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked (Luke 11: 27).</p><p>(5) The fifth thing that the Quran tells us about Jesus is that God had enjoined upon him Prayer and alms-giving. About this the Bible says as follows:</p><p>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed (Luke 5: 16).</p><p>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground (Luke 22: 44).</p><p>Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s (Matt. 22: 21).</p><p>(6) Last of all, Jesus has been described as being humble and blessed with success. In regard to this the Bible says:</p><p>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls (Matt. 11: 29).</p><p>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass (Matt. 21: 5).</p><p>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16: 33).</p>"

It cannot be said about a person who died an accursed death that he died a blessed and peaceful death. But the mere fact of a person being put on the cross or meeting a violent end does not conflict with the idea of peace and blessedness to which this verse refers. It is an accepted fact of history that the Prophet Yahya was murdered while in jail but the words \"peace was on him the day he died\" have also been used about him in v. 16 above. So these words have been used about Jesus and Yahya to show that both these Prophets succeeded in their missions, and a person who succeeds in his mission and whose work is carried on after his death and who is remembered with love and respect cannot be said to have suffered death or to have been deprived of \"peace\". Jesus has left behind him a large community of followers and Yahya’s name is remembered with love and respect. Thus both Jesus and Yahya died a blessed death and enjoy everlasting peace.</p><p>The words, <i>peace was on me the day I was born</i> may also be understood as containing a hint that the birth of Jesus was out of the ordinary. These words have also been used about Yahya in verse 16 above because his birth, too, took place in extraordinary circumstances. He was born when his father had reached an extremely old age and his mother was barren.</p><p>The expression, <i>the day I shall be raised up to life again</i>, may also imply: \"The day when I shall be raised again in the form of another Prophet who will testify to my truth.\" The implied reference may be to the Holy Prophet who bore witness to the truth of Jesus.</p>"

The Jews, the Christians and the Muslims all hold widely different views about Jesus’ birth, the manner of his death, and about the account of his life. The Jews believe that he was born out of legal wedlock and therefore his birth was illegitimate. He was a false Prophet and therefore deservedly met an accursed death on the cross. The Christians hold that Jesus’ mother became conceived of the Holy Ghost, therefore he was the son of God. He persuaded himself to be put on the cross and by his death he atoned for the sins of all humanity. He remained dead for three days and then rose up to heaven. He is a part of the Holy Trinity and yet is God Himself. Orthodox Muslims believe that he was miraculously born without the instrumentality of a father as the result of a special Divine decree. He was an Israelite Prophet. The Jews tried to crucify him but instead succeeded only in crucifying another person who by God’s special decree was made to look like Jesus and Jesus bodily went up to heaven where he is sitting by the right hand of God and will someday descend from heaven to win for Muslims the kingdom of the whole world. The so-called modernists among Muslims think that he was the son of Joseph the carpenter, and died a natural death, and so there was nothing miraculous or unusual about his birth, death or his life. He was only an Israelite Prophet. The orthodox Ahmadis, however, believe that his birth took place without the agency of a father as the result of a special Divine decree, and that this unusual form of birth constituted a rebuke and a warning to the Israelites that on account of their persistent rejection of truth and God’s Messengers, and their immoral practices the whole Israelite nation had been rendered quite unfit to give birth to a Prophet of God and therefore prophethood, in accordance with God’s covenant with Abraham, was transferred from the House of Israel to that of Ishmael (see Introduction to this <i>Surah</i>). They further believe that Jesus was hung on the cross by the Jews but did not die there and was taken down from it alive and for three days remained in a tomb hewn out of a rock and then travelled to Kashmir to preach his Message to the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. He lived up to the ripe old age of 120 years, died a natural death and lies buried in Khanyar street in Srinagar, Kashmir. In fact, the existence of so many and so serious differences about Jesus implies a rebuke to Christians that there is nothing certain about their god.</p><p>The expression \"son of Mary\" (ابن مریم) is Jesus’ distinctive name. Whereas on the one hand it seems to point to his fatherless birth, on the other it confers on him a name which is incapable of being confused with that of anybody else. The Gospels have also used for Jesus the epithet ابن آدم (son of man) but this epithet has been used in the Bible for other persons also. So ابن مریم (son of Mary) is at once a distinctive and descriptive name of Jesus.</p>"

Jesus enjoys no special prerogative in this respect and is therefore no more a son of God than those persons who have also been addressed as such.</p><p>The Bible says:</p><p>(a) \"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God\" (Luke 20: 36);</p><p>(b) \"For I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn\" (Jer. 31:9);</p><p>(c) \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name\" (Matt. 6:9);</p><p>(d) \"For if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you\" (Matt. 6:14);</p><p>(e) \"That your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses\" (Mark 11: 25);</p><p>(f) \"Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things\" (Luke 12: 30);</p><p>(g) \"We have one Father, even God\" (John 8: 41);</p><p>(h) \"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all\" (Ephes. 4:6);</p><p>(i) \"Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn\" (Exod. 4:22).</p><p>The Bible rather supports the Quranic statement, viz.<i>it does not befit the Majesty of Allah to take unto Himself a son.</i>He is the One Lord, God, Who has, or needs, no son.</p><p>It says:</p><p>(a) \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord\" (Deut. 6:4);</p><p>(b) \"I am the Lord, that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images\" (Isa. 42:8);</p><p>(c) \"Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord\" (Mark 12: 29);</p><p>(d) \"To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty\" (Jude 1: 25);</p><p>(e) \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory forever and ever\" (I Timothy 1: 17).</p><p>The verse under comment gives three reasons why God does not stand in need of a son:(1) if God were supposed to have a son, He must be subject to carnal desires and must have a wife to satisfy them; (2) He must be subject to decay and death because the procreation of species which the attribution of a son to God implies, is the characteristic of mortals; and (3) He must require a helper to assist Him in His work or to continue his work after His death. But God as represented by Islam is completely free from all these defects and therefore needs no son. In fact, the Christian dogma of sonship of Jesus is an insoluble riddle and beyond human comprehension. If Jesus is God’s son, then God will have to be admitted as incapable of carrying on the affairs of the universe alone and unaided, and therefore will have to be accepted as imperfect and defective. But because God is Perfect and All-Powerful, therefore He needs no son and no helper. Again, according to the Christian dogma each of the three deities, God, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, being perfect can and should carry on the work of the universe unaided and yet these three combine to do the thing which each one is able to accomplish by himself. This is absurd.</p><p>Those who are ignorant of Arabic language pretend to find in the word کن (be) a ground for their belief in the eternity and indestructibility of matter and soul. They argue in this way. This word shows that there had already existed something to which the order کن (be) was given. But in the Arabic language this word, besides being addressed to a thing, is also used to express a greatly felt desire. In an expedition the Holy Prophet’s very brave and loyal companion, Abu Khaithamah happened to be absent. The Prophet keenly felt his absence. When in the midst of the battle he saw from a great distance a rider coming to him at full speed he exclaimed کن ابا خیثمة i.e. would that it were Abu Khaithamah; and lo! it was really Abu Khaithamah (Halbiyyah). So an Arab would use the word کن when he would passionately desire a thing to happen.</p><p>According to this sense of کن the expression کن فیکون would mean that when God desires or intends that a thing should be, it comes into being or that when God expresses a desire it takes a concrete form. The words lend no support to the view that soul and matter are primeval or eternal. See also 2:117-118.</p>"

They say ابرمه i.e. he twisted it (the rope) well. He made it firm, strong, solid (Lane). Abraham might have been so called because he was endowed to an unusual degree with conversational ability of a high mark. He was an irresistible debater. His talk was very effective and his arguments strong. A reference to this quality of Abraham is to be found in 2:259 and 6:76-81. Or Abram may have come to be called Abraham after God had made His covenant with him and had promised to multiply him exceedingly. God said: \"As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for father of many nations have I made thee\" (Gen. 17:4-5). In the Quran also Abraham has been called امة which means, \"a nation\", \"a people\", \"a race\" (16:121).</p><p>Abraham was a native of Ur of the Chaldees in Iraq. His people worshipped the sun and the stars. Their chief god was Merodach or (Madruk). It was also called Bel, i.e. Lord (Enc. Bib.).</p><p>Abraham was a great iconoclast. He preached the Unity and Oneness of God and strongly denounced and condemned idol-worship. By his iconoclastic activities he incurred the enmity of his father and so with his wife and his nephew Lot, he had to leave his native place for Canaan the land which God had promised to give to his seed (Gen 12:7). When Canaan suffered from a severe famine Abraham left it for Egypt where he married Hagar, the mother of Ishmael. For a detailed account of Abraham see 6:75.</p><p>الکتاب (the Book) in this verse means the Quran. The Holy Prophet is here directed to relate the story of Abraham as it is given in the Quran and not as it is related in the Bible. While the Quran depicts Abraham as a truthful man the Bible accuses him of telling lies (Gen. 20:13).</p><p>صدیق (a truthful man) is the intensified form of صادق which is active participle from صدقwhich means, he spoke the truth (Lane). صادق means one who speaks the truth. صدیق being the intensive form of صادق has four meanings; (a) one who very generally and often speaks the truth; (b) one who never tells a lie; (c) one who is so habituated to speaking truth that it becomes impossible for him to tell a lie; and (d) one who is truthful in his talk and substantiates the truth of his talk and beliefs by his actions and deeds. The speaking of truth becomes, as it were, a part of his being, a second nature with him (Lane). This is the highest stage of صدیقیت (the quality or condition of being truthful).</p><p>The word صدیق possesses a double connotation. While on the one hand it means one who is highly truthful, on the other it denotes a spiritual rank next only to the rank of prophethood. In fact, every quality possesses two connotations and two uses. It is used as an attribute and it also expresses a rank. In the present verse صدیق has been used to express only the attribute and quality of truthfulness and not the rank of صدیق which is included in the rank of نبی (a Prophet) which has also been mentioned in regard to Abraham in this verse. The verse means that Abraham was a Prophet of God and one of his most prominent and distinctive qualities was that he was truthful par excellence.</p><p>The Quran has laid great stress on the truthfulness of Abraham perhaps because in some future time lies were to be attributed to him by some commentators of the Quran.</p><p>It seems appropriate and pertinent to write here a few words about the order and arrangement of the verses of the present <i>Surah</i> because some Christian writers have found fault with the chronological order of the incidents mentioned in it. In fact the central theme of this <i>Surah</i> is to disprove and demolish the Christian dogma of godhead of Jesus Christ. The <i>Surah</i> opens with a brief mention of Zachariah, the father of Yahya who was a forerunner of Jesus. Zachariah’s mention is followed by a concise description of the birth of Yahya. Then a somewhat detailed description is given of the birth of Jesus who was the harbinger of the Holy Prophet and light is shed on the falsity of Christian beliefs and doctrines about him and his mother. This description of Jesus is followed by a narration of some important incidents in the life of Abraham. This seems to be a historical anachronism but in reality it is not. The Quran is not a book of history. It sometimes deliberately departs from the chronological order of events. The account of Abraham given in the present and the following verses is a case in point. The account of Jesus is followed by that of Abraham in order to drive home the point that when Abraham, the great progenitor of Moses who was the Founder of the Mosaic Dispensation of which Christianity is only an offshoot, was a firm believer in the Unity of God, how could Jesus depart from the Faith of his forefather, and claim to be God or son of God? Secondly, God had made a promise with Abraham that He would multiply him exceedingly through his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac. God’s promise with Abraham was fulfilled first through Isaac, and then when Isaac’s progeny disobeyed and defied Divine commandments and consistently rejected Divine Prophets and went so far as to kill John and crucify Jesus, God’s covenant with Abraham became transferred to Ishmael and was finally and fully fulfilled through the latter’s progeny. This is the real reason why the account of Jesus is followed by that of Abraham. After this a brief mention is made of Moses who was a descendant of Jacob and in whom God’s covenant with Abraham through Isaac found its highest fulfilment. After dealing with God’s covenant with Abraham through Isaac, the <i>Surah</i> proceeds to make a mention of the Divine promise with Abraham through Ishmael. This is why after Moses, mention has been made of Ishmael and this is the significance of the order which the Quran has kept in view while giving an account of the life of some Prophets and making only a brief mention of others and this is the right and natural order which should have been observed while dealing with the subject under discussion. The taunt of some Christian critics of Islam that the seeming historical anachronism was due to the Holy Prophet’s lack of the knowledge of history is absurd because elsewhere (chapter Hud) the Quran has given the accounts of some Prophets of very remote past in their proper chronological order which fact has been admitted by fair-minded Christian writers themselves.</p>"

According to Arabic usage ی has been converted into ت (Lane &amp; Aqrab).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The point whether Abraham’s اب (<i>ab</i>) whose name at another place in the Quran (6:75) has been given as Azar was his father, uncle or grandfather, is much in dispute. In 2:134 Ishmael who was Jacob’s uncle has been spoken of as his اب (<i>ab</i>). Whether Azar was Abraham’s father or uncle does not possess much significance. From a study of all relevant historical facts, however, we are inclined to the view that Azar was Abraham’s father, though according to some Talmudic traditions Abraham’s father had died while he was young and he was left an orphan.</p><p>In Genesis (11: 26) Abraham’s father’s name has been given as Terah while Luke (3: 34) gives it as Thara. The Talmud agrees with Luke and says that his name was Thara. It also gives his name as Zarah. Eusebius, the father of ecclesiastical history, however, gives Athar as the name of the great Patriarch’s father (Sale). This shows that even among the Jews there existed no unanimity of views as to the name of Abraham’s father. The fact that Eusebius followed neither Genesis (11: 26) nor (Luke 3: 34) indicates that he had very strong reasons to differ from these two well-known sources. The two names, Athar of Eusebius and Azar of the Quran closely resemble each other. The Quranic version is therefore much more reliable and akin to reality than that of the Bible. See also 6:75.</p><p>The attributes \"All-Hearing\" and \"All-Seeing\" are among the most important Divine attributes. It is our conviction that God sees us when we are in trouble and hears our prayers when we pray to Him which is really at the root of our belief in God. If once we cease to believe in these two attributes, we cease to believe in God. But these two attributes are here further complemented by a third—the attribute غنیwhich means, One Who has no need of others and is Self-Sufficient but Whose help others need and upon Whom they are dependent. If God is not غنی and cannot come to our help when we need it, then His attributes \"All-Seeing\" and \"All-Hearing\" are of no use. Abraham has indeed adduced a most convincing and unassailable argument against idol-worship, viz. if the idols do neither see when their votaries are in trouble, nor hear their prayers when they call on them, nor do they come to their help when they need it, then what sense or purpose there is in worshipping such useless things?</p>"

This significance of the word is clear from the verse itself, because nobody has ever been seen to worship Satan in the sense that he prostrates before him and prays to him. It also appears from this verse that the word شیطان (Satan) here does not mean the 'Devil' or even the idols. Here it only signifies evil inclinations, wrong ideas and beliefs and bad associates and evil spirits. According to these meanings of the words عبادة and شیطان the verse would signify that one should not follow blindly or unthinkingly evil inclinations, wrong beliefs or bad friends or associates. Such an attitude on one’s part is tantamount to giving them Divine status and to worshipping them.</p><p>The word عصیا (rebel) also indicates that شیطان in this verse does not signify idols made of wood or stone because idols of stone do not disobey God. From the previous verse one may have been led to think that Abraham had advised his father against idol-worship only.

Punishment seems more appropriately related to God’s other attributes such as الجبار (the Subduer), القھار (the Most Supreme), ذو انتقام (the Avenger) etc. In fact, every punishment is the result of the defiance or disobedience of a particular Divine attribute. Sometimes a person is punished because he defies the Divine attribute الغفار (the Great Forgiver), at another time punishment comes upon him because he disobeys the Divine attribute الکریم (Most Generous) and so on. In this verse, in fact in the whole <i>Surah</i>, شرک i.e. idolatry, has been repeatedly denounced and condemned in the strongest and most scathing terms and the Divine attribute الرحمن i.e. the Gracious, has also been mentioned again and again because شرک (idolatry) in every shape and form is the direct result of denial of رحمانیةi.e. Divine grace. The two great idolatrous peoples—the Hindus and the Christians, have hopelessly fallen victim to the most degraded form of idolatry because they both deny رحمانیة i.e. Divine grace—the former by believing in the indestructibility and eternity of matter and soul and the latter by subscribing to the foolish doctrine that salvation is impossible without Atonement. So the mentioning together of the Divine attribute الرحمن (the Gracious) and Divine punishment shows that it is not رحمانیة i.e. Divine grace, which is the cause of Divine punishment, rather it is its denial and rejection.</p><p>شیطان (Satan), as stated above, may signify man’s evil inclinations and propensities, his bad friends and associates and evil spirits that cast their shadows upon him and lead him deeper and deeper into sin and transgression.</p>"

In Moses, God’s covenant with Abraham about the progeny of Isaac, found its fullest and completest manifestation. The visible mark of this divine covenant was the bestowal of Canaan on Abraham’s progeny (Gen. 17:8) which took place in the time of Moses’ Successor. The Israelite Prophets who came after Moses were only Reformer-Prophets who carried on and fulfilled his work and mission. This is why after Moses God adverts to His promise to Abraham about Ishmael which saw its sublimest and most complete and perfect manifestation and consummation in the Holy Prophet of Islam who was a descendant of Ishmael.</p><p>The words, <i>he was a Messenger and a Prophet</i>, explain and remove a popular misconception. According to popular notion a رسول (Messenger) is one who brings a new Law and a new Book and a نبی (Prophet) is one who is commissioned by God only for the reformation of his people. He also receives Divine revelation but brings no Law or Book containing new commandments and ordinances. According to this popular notion every رسول (Messenger) is necessarily a نبی (Prophet) but not every نبی a رسول. The verse under comment, however, demolishes this wrong notion because if a رسول (Messenger) is one who brings a new Book and a new Law and as such is necessarily a نبی (Prophet), then the addition of the word نبی to the word رسول in this and other verses is superfluous and redundant. In fact, every رسولis a نبی and every نبی a رسول. These two words represent two aspects of the same office and two functions of the same person. A Divine Reformer is a رسول inasmuch as he receives messages from God (رسالت meaning a message) and he is a نبی in the sense that he conveys those Messages to the people to whom he is sent (نبوت meaning the conveying of a message). Thus every رسول(Messenger) is a نبی (Prophet) because after receiving Divine Messages he conveys them to his people and every نبی is a رسول because he conveys to his people those Messages which he receives from God. Only the functions of نبی follow those of رسول. In his capacity as رسولhe first receives messages from God and then in his capacity as نبیhe conveys them to his people. This is why here and everywhere in the Quran when these two words—رسول and نبی occur together, invariably the word نبی follows the word رسول because that is the natural order. </p><p>See also 7:158, 159; 19:31, 55. The bringing of a new Book or a new Law, therefore, is not the necessary concomitant of a نبی or a رسول. A رسول or a نبیmay or may not bring a new Law. All Messengers (رسول) and Prophets (نبی) are of two categories—(a) those that bring a new Book and a new Law and (b) those that do not. This classification of رسول and نبی into two categories is supported by the Quranitself. See 5:45.</p>"

In the verse under comment the word الایمن has been used with regard to Moses while with regard to the Holy Prophet the word مبارک (blessed) is used. This word has a deeper and more comprehensive meaning than ایمن. The Quran has been called مبارک i.e. a blessed Book (6:93,156; 21:51). The place where the Holy Prophet was born was مبارک i.e. blessed (3:97), and so was his landing in Medina (23:30). The divinelight which he received has also been described as مبارک (blessed) (24:36) and the word of God came to him inلیلة مبارکة i.e. blessed night (44:4).</p>"

And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation (Gen. 17:19, 20).</p><p>The covenant began with Isaac and in fulfilment of it God raised a long line of Prophets among his descendants, and also gave them worldly dominion, power and wealth. The covenant found its highest fulfilment in Moses. When, however, the long line of Prophets who came after Moses as his successors terminated with Jesus, the second part of the covenant which was to be fulfilled through Ishmael came into operation and prophethood passed from the House of Israel to that of Ishmael and this was quite in harmony with the covenant which God had established with Abraham regarding the conferring of His favour upon him and his progeny. This is why after Moses’ mention has been made of Ishmael. The account of Ishmael is introduced with the words واذکر (and relate) which shows that one chapter of religious history—that of the House of Israel, is closed and a new one has begun. The Christians have been further told in this verse that the divine covenant has not terminated with Jesus but in keeping with the promise of God with Abraham has only been transferred to the progeny of Ishmael.</p>"

They say أدرس الکتاب i.e. he read the book or he read it repeatedly so as to remember it; or he made it easy to remember by much reading; or he learned or studied it. درسه الکتاب(<i>darrasahul-kitab</i>) or ادرسه means, he taught him the book (Lane). إدریس which means, one who reads much or teaches much is derived from ادرس as یعقوب is from عقب and اضحاک is from ضحک and یسوع is from ساع and as اسماعیل is the combination of سمع and ایل (meaning God heard) and اسرائیل is the, combination of یسر and ایل (meaning the warrior of God).</p><p>Much difference of opinion exists among lexicologists about the origin of the word إدریس. According to Lisan it is a non-Arabic proper noun. According to Asma‘i, Qurtubi and Ibn Hayyan, it is not Arabic. Ibn Sikkit, however, is of the opinion that إدریس (Idris) is an Arabic name. He says that it is derived from أدرس as ابلیس is derived from أبلس. But whatever the difference of opinion the Arabs were familiar with this name even before Islam.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>Now who is this Idris? Most of the commentators of the Quran are of the opinion that he is Enoch of the Bible.حنوکand إدریس closely resemble each other in their meanings and significations. Whereas إدریس means one who reads much or instructs much, حنوک means instruction or dedication (Enc. Bib.). Moreover, the account of Enoch given in the Bible and in Jewish religious literature closely resembles that of Idris as given in the Quran. In the Bible we have: And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him (Gen. 5:24). In Targum, a famous book of Jewish traditions he has been called a holy man of God whom He gave the titles of \"Safra Rabba\" and \"Metatron\"(both words meaning a learned man or religious savant) and took up to heaven (Jew. Enc.). In the Jewish book named \"Sefer Hanok\" (the book of Hanuk) it is written that inhabitants of the earth became wicked, therefore God took up Hanuk to heaven and made him a guardian of the heavenly treasures and the chief of angels. In another book named \"Hayye Hanok\" it is written that he was a holy and righteous priest whom God sent to the world for its reformation, but when it became full of sins, God raised him up to heaven (Jew. Enc.). This account of Enoch resembles very much the picture of Idris as given in the Quran in the words: <i>He was a truthful man and a Prophet and We exalted him to a lofty station</i>. These commendatory expressions about Idris serve to demolish the false notions held about Jesus. The godhead of Jesus, more than anything else, rests on the belief that he was taken up to heaven alive. Now if, as Christians believe, God took up Jesus to heaven according to the present verse, Idris too was exalted to a very high station in heaven, and according to the Bible Enoch (Idris) also walked with God and was taken up to heaven (Gen. 5:24). If Jesus could be regarded as Divine and is entitled to a special spiritual status on the assumption of his having been taken up to heaven, then Idris of the Quran or Enoch of the Bible, on that very score is entitled to even a higher spiritual station. If Jesus has been called son of God in the Bible, Enoch has been called the father of the sons of God in Jewish literature. The Book of Enoch which was originally written in Hebrew and later on was translated into Greek and then into Latin contains a full account of Enoch’s life. Its translation in Russian makes very useful and interesting reading.</p><p>Ishmael and Idris have been mentioned together in the verse under comment and in 21:86, the only two places where mention has been made of Idris in the Quran. It is so because Ishmael bears a very close resemblance to him. According to the Quran Ishmael was a truthful man and so was Idris. God had raised Idris to a lofty spiritual station and so had He raised Ishmael. About Enoch we read in the Bible that God walked with him (Gen. 5:24) and about Ishmael the Bible says: \"Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!\" (Gen. 17:18).</p>"

There was nothing in him that could entitle him to some special position. (2) These righteous and holy men were Divine Prophets and as such sinless. The Jews in the Old Testament (Gen. 9:21-23; 19:31-38; 20:2; Exod. 32:1-4); and Christians in the New Testament (John 10:8) hurled at these paragons of piety and righteousness very filthy charges, the former in order to screen their own crimes and the latter in order to establish the exclusive sinlessness of Jesus. Special stress has been laid on their holiness in the verse under comment and it is in order to clear them completely of the charges attributed to them and also to demolish the wrong notion of the exclusive sinlessness of Jesus that the words \"whom We guided and chose\" have been used about them.</p><p>Some commentators of the Quran think that the words '<i>of the posterity of Adam' </i>refer to Idris, and<i> whom we carried in the Ark with Noah </i>to Abraham, and the words, <i>of the posterity of Abraham</i>, refer to Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the words, <i>of the posterity of</i>, understood before the word Israel, to Moses, Aaron, Zachariah, Yahya and Jesus, all of whom have been mentioned in the preceding verses of the present <i>Surah</i>.</p>"

Commentators of the Quran generally agree that in Arabic this word has no root and is used as a proper name for the place of punishment reserved for the evildoers in the next world. Non-Arabic lexicographers, however, are of the opinion that it is an Aramaic word and is used for the place of punishment after death. In Hebrew it is used as Gehenna which in Aramaic originally was 'Hinnom' but later on came to be changed into \"Ge-Hinnom\" (Enc. Bib.) which means, \"the valley of death or destruction.\" The word \"Ge-Hinnom\" also seems to have been a distorted form of the Arabic words ذو and ھنم, the latter word meaning 'a leopard'; and so ذو ھنم means a place where leopards live. Thus \"Ge-Hinnom\" which in Aramaic means the valley of death and destruction was originally ذو ھنم. The non-Arabs generally change the letter ذinto ج; so ذو ھنم became converted into the Aramaic 'Ge-Hinnom' and the Arabs borrowed it from the non-Arabs and turned it into جھنم. The word may also have been a combination of جھن which means, he went near, and جھمwhich means, he became contracted in the face. So جھنم may mean a thing or place which a person at first likes but when he goes near it he comes to dislike it and contracts his face to show his dislike for it. Thus the very construction of the word جھنم explains its nature and character, i.e. at first a person commits hellish deeds, thinking them to be good but when as a result of those deeds he approaches near Hell, he dislikes it and contracts his face to show his dislike. See also 2:207.</p><p>The word الشیاطین (Satans) applies to those philosophers and exponents of a materialistic concept of life who engender in the minds of disbelievers doubts regarding life after death.</p>"

It applies, as the context shows, only to the disbelievers and to those who doubt the existence of the life after death. All these categories of men have been mentioned in the preceding verses. According to Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Ikrimah, another reading of منکم (of you) is منھم (of them) and the former used to say that the expression منکم is addressed to disbelievers (Qurtubi). So it is to these people i.e. disbelievers mentioned in vv. 67-69 above that the pronoun کم (you) clearly refers. On the other hand the Quran quite clearly and emphatically supports the view that the righteous believers will not go to Hell; they will bask in the sunshine of God’s love and mercy (27:90; 39:62; 43:69; etc.) and will be far removed from the fire of Hell and will not hear even its faintest sound (21:102-103). But if the pronoun (you) be taken to include both the believers and the disbelievers, then in the case of disbelievers the verse would mean that all of them will go to Hell and in the case of believers the fire of Hell referred to in the verse would mean the fire of trials and tribulations through which they have to pass in the present life and which they endure with patience and fortitude and out of which eventually they are taken to be brought into the haven of divine bliss and peace as the next verse shows. This reference is supported by several sayings of the Holy Prophet in which he has likened fever to the fire of Hell. He is reported to have said: The fever is a believer’s share of the Hellfire (Qurtubi as quoted by Tabari).</p><p>The Holy Prophet himself has explained the meaning of this verse. His wife Hafsah is reported to have said: \"On one occasion when the Prophet said that none of those of his Companions who had taken part in the battle of Badr or Uhud will go to Hell, I drew his attention to the present verse, upon which he slightly reprimanded me for having misunderstood its meaning and directed me to read the next verse\" (Muslim as quoted by Jami‘ul-Bayan). The fact that the Holy Prophet referred Hafsah to the next verse (v. 73) shows that he also understood the word ثم occurring in that verse to mean \"and\", and had taken the next verse as an independent and separate clause, otherwise he could not have reprimanded Hafsah for having misunderstood the meaning of the verse under comment.</p>"

There seems to be no real difference between the two alternative senses, because Paradise is the House of God and going to Paradise is as good as going before God. The verse may also apply to two resurrections; the one in this world and the other in the next. Resurrection in the next world will both be individual and collective. Immediately after its departure from the physical body the human soul begins to taste of the fruits of the works, good or bad, a man might have done in this world. This state of the soul is known by its individual resurrection in which its experience of the reward or punishment, as the case may be, of the next life is partial and incomplete. The Resurrection on the Last Day, however, will be collective when the whole of mankind will be brought before God’s Judgement Seat. Then the realization by the soul of its state of bliss or punishment will be complete. That will be the final Resurrection. The significance of the verse as is clear from many sayings of the Holy Prophet, is that there will be great confusion and bewilderment on the Day of Resurrection. But immediately after the initial shock the righteous will regain their composure and peace of mind and will be honoured with the gift of God’s favours and blessings.</p>"

According to Imam Raghib الشفع signifies the adjoining of a thing to its like; thus the word has the significance of likeness or similarity also. Thus الشفاعة has come to mean interceding or praying for a person on the ground that he is connected with the intercessor or is like or similar to him (Aqrab, Lane &amp; Mufradat).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>الشفاعة (intercession) is governed by the following four conditions:</p><p>1. He who intercedes has a special connection with the person (or Being) with whom he wishes to intercede and enjoys his special favour, for without such connection he dare not intercede nor can intercession be fruitful.</p><p>2. The person for whom intercession is to be made must have a true and real connection with the intercessor, for none would think of interceding for a person unless the latter is specially connected with him.</p><p>3. The person in whose favour intercession is sought must generally deserve the description of a good person and must be one who has made an honest effort to win the pleasure of God (21:29). If he ever happens to fall into sin, it is in a moment of weakness. A wicked man cannot enjoy true and real connection with a holy person.</p><p>4. Intercession can only be made with God’s express permission (2:256; 10:4).</p><p>For a detailed note on الشفاعة see 2:49.</p><p>It may be noted that of all prophets and messengers of God the Holy Prophet alone will be granted permission to intercede on the Last Day.</p>"

In the present and preceding four verses special stress has been laid on the refutation and condemnation of this dogma. It is worthy of special note that the Divine attribute \"Rahman\" has been repeatedly referred to in this <i>Surah</i>—it has been mentioned as many as sixteen times. As the fundamental dogma of the sonship of Jesus and its corollary, the dogma of Atonement, involve a denial of the Divine attribute \"Rahman\" and as the central theme of this <i>Surah</i> is the refutation of this dogma, this attribute inevitably has been repeatedly referred to. The dogma of Atonement implies that God cannot forgive the sins of men whereas the Divine attribute \"Rahman\" implies that He can and actually often does forgive them, hence its repetition in this <i>Surah</i>.</p>"
