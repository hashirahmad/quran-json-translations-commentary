                    "note": "<p><strong>Important Words:</strong></p><p>المسجور (swollen) is derived from سجر. They say سجر الماء النھر i.e. the water filled the stream. سجر التنور (<i>sajjara</i>) means, he filled the oven with firewood and heated it. سجر الماء means, he made the water to flow forth whithersoever it would. مسجور means, filled; kindled; still or quiet, or still and full at the same time; empty (Lane &amp; Aqrab).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>It is the characteristic of the Quran that when it has to make a firm declaration and impart emphasis and certainty to that declaration it swears by, or cites as witnesses, certain beings or objects or natural laws or phenomena. In the first few verses the <i>Surah</i> swears by certain things intimately connected with Moses—the counterpart of the Holy Prophet. It was on the Tur that the revelation was vouchsafed to Moses which embodied his Law and the prophecies which spoke about the appearance of a great Divine Prophet from among the brethren of the Israelites. That Prophet was to be the like of Moses and was to shine forth from mount Paran and to come with ten thousand saints, holding in his right hand a fiery law (Deut. 18:18 &amp; 33: 2). Evidently, the Holy Prophet was the Divine Messenger spoken of in the prophecy. His advent is likened in the Quran to the advent of Moses (73:16). He shined forth from mount Paran, holding the Quran in his right hand and entered Mecca at the head of ten thousand saintly warriors. The <i>Surah</i> then cites, as evidence, the \"Inscribed Book\" which is the Bible or the Quran, preferably the latter, and which stands as a standing and incontrovertible testimony to the truth of the claims of the Holy Prophet. \"The Frequented House\"—the Ka‘bah,—more than anything else, shows that the religion of which it forms the citadel and the centre is God’s Final Dispensation. The site where the Ka‘bah stands was a dry barren waste where no sign of human or animal life was visible. Here, long centuries ago, a holy man of God—the Patriarch Abraham, aided and assisted by his son, Ishmael, while raising its foundations, had prayed that the place may become a haven of safety and security and may constitute the centre from where God’s Unity and Oneness may be proclaimed and preached. It was \"this barren waste that didst not bear and didst not travail with child\"which gave birth to the greatest son of man, as was spoken of old (Isa. 54:1). Here it was (as was foretold) that \"the glory of God rose and shone; the multitudes of camels came, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, all came from Sheba and brought gold and incense and shewed forth the praises of the Lord\" (Isa. 60:1-6).</p><p>The reference in the words \"the Elevated Roof,\" being to heaven, the verse (v.6) signifies that the disbelievers are so unwise as not to see this simple fact that whereas the Prophet continuously receives Divine help and his cause progresses and prospers, failure dogs their footsteps and all their designs and plans against the Prophet prove abortive. In the words\"the Swollen Sea,\" the reference may be to the Mediterranean Sea where Pharaoh and his mighty hosts were drowned while pursuing the Israelites or they may refer to the battlefield of Badr where all the great leaders of the Quraish were killed, as it was known as البحر i.e. the sea (Nihayah). The words may also apply to the Quran which like a fathomless sea of spiritual knowledge continues to throw out treasures of divine knowledge. \"Why do not the disbelievers,\" the verse purports to say, \"take a lesson from these patent facts and realize that opposition to God’s Messengers does not pay and will end in their ruin?\"</p>"

They say حار الثوب i.e. he washed the cloth and made it white. أحور (fem. حوراء) means, a man whose eyes are characterized by the quality termed حور (<i>hawarun</i>), i.e. intense whiteness of the white of the eye and intense blackness of the black thereof, with intense whiteness or fairness of the rest of the person. أحور also means, pure or clear intellect. مایعیش بأحور is said of a person whose affairs are not clean (Lane, Mufradat &amp; Taj).</p><p>عین is the plural of both أعین (<i>a‘yan</i>) and عیناء which are derived from عین (‘<i>ayina</i>) which means, he had wide black eyes. أعین and عیناء respectively mean, man and woman having black, wide and large eyes. عیناء also means, a good or beautiful saying or word (Lane, Mufradat &amp; Taj).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>Description of the rewards and punishments of Heaven and Hell as given in some Quranic <i>Surahs</i>, particularly in Ar-Rahman, Al-Waqi‘ah and in the present <i>Surah</i> call for an explanatory note. The following points may be borne in mind for an appreciation of life after death:</p><p>1. According to the Quran, God’s handiwork as manifested in the creation of the universe, and in that of man placed at its centre, shows that man’s life on earth has a purpose higher and nobler and beyond mere eating and drinking or leading a more or less circumscribed existence (23:115-116).</p><p>2. There is a life after death and that life is the continuation of the life which man leads in this world. One’s heaven or hell begins from this very world; death only opening up vast and unknown vistas of ever-expanding spiritual progress.</p><p>3. As soon as the human soul leaves this tabernacle of clay, it is given a new body, because the soul can make no progress or enjoy no bliss or feel no pain without a body. Its development and progress depend upon its permanent connection with a body. The new body is as fine and delicate as the soul was in this world. In fact, it is the very soul in a new transformation which after having passed through certain experiences develops a new soul which possesses far higher and finer and more delicate faculties and perception than the soul from which it emanates. To this new soul the old soul serves as a body and man is able to perceive things through his new senses which he could perceive formerly only through the soul, and is able to partake of the pains and pleasures of the next world—the present body of clay being quite unfit for the new experience. That is why the Quran says, \"And no soul knows what joy of the eyes is kept hidden for them, as a reward for their good works\" (32:18). And the Holy Prophet explained this Quranic verse in a well-known saying. viz. \"No eye has seen the blessings of Paradise, nor has any ear heard of them nor can human mind conceive of them\" (Bukhari<i>, Kitab bad’ul-khalq</i>).</p><p>4. Life after death is only an image and manifestation of the present life and the rewards and punishments of the next world would be only embodiments and images of the actions done in this life. Heaven and Hell are not new material worlds which come from outside. It is true that they shall be visible and palpable, call them material, if you please, but they are only embodiments of the spiritual facts of this life. The spiritual torture of this world has been represented in the Quran as a physical punishment in the next. The chains to be put round the necks of disbelievers, for instance, represent the desires of this world which keep a man’s head bent upon the earth, and it is these desires that shall assume the shape of chains. Similarly, the entanglements of this world shall be seen as fetters on the feet in the next. The heart-burning of this world shall likewise be clearly seen as flames of burning fire, and the love which a believer feels for his Lord and Creator will appear embodied as wine in the life to come, etc. Thus there will be gardens, streams, milk, honey, flesh of birds, wine, fruits, thrones, companions and many other things in Paradise; but they will not be the things of this world but the embodiments of spiritual facts of the life of this world.</p><p>5. There will be no sin, levity, or vain talk in Paradise, no pleasures of the flesh as we understand them, but all-pervading peace and pleasure of God (56:26-27). In view of this Quranic conception of Paradise, it is the height of ignorance or blind prejudice to suggest that the Quran promises a sensuous Paradise to its followers.</p><p>Moreover, the words زوجنا and عین and as explained under Important Words above, present no difficulty and, in view of these explanations, the verse may mean that in Paradise the righteous servants of God will be made to live with pure and clean companions whose faces will be shining with radiant spiritual beauty; or they will have as companions fair maidens, i.e. their wives.</p><p>Besides, the promise, made to the righteous in this ands the following verses, was literally fulfilled when the Muslims conquered vast territories of the Byzantine and Iranian Empires, and all these things fell into their hands and thus the promise constituted an incontrovertible testimony to the fact that the promise about the next life is also true.</p>"

They say من الرجل i.e. he weakened the man and took away his strength; من الحبلmeans, he cut off the rope. من الشیء means, the thing diminished. من الناقة means, he tired out or jaded the she-camel. منونmeans, death; time; destiny or fate. ریب المنون or ریب الزمان or ریب الدھر means, the calamities or vicissitudes of time (Lane).</p><p>نتربص (we are waiting for) is derived from ربص.

An Arab poet says:</p><p>تربص بھا ریب المنون لعلھا</p><p>تطلق یوما او یموت حلیلھا</p><p>i.e. wait thou for the vicissitudes of time to befall her; perhaps she might be divorced some day or her husband might die (Lane).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The Holy Prophet’s enemies accused him of being a soothsayer, a poet and even a madman. The verse implies the refutation of all these foolish charges. The Prophet is not a poet (the verse purports to say) because poets have no fixed ideal or programme in life. They only indulge in daydreaming, and as it were, \"wander about distractedly in every valley\" (26:226), but the Holy Prophet has before him a great and noble aim—the regeneration of a corrupt and degenerate society. He is neither a soothsayer, because soothsayers dabble in occult sciences and make mere conjectures and guesses. They try to hoodwink simple-minded people by clever contrivances but the Holy Prophet is universally known to be an honest and sincere man. Nor is he a madman because madmen are not known to have brought about the great and wonderful revolution that he has, among his completely demoralized, degenerate and degraded people.</p>"
