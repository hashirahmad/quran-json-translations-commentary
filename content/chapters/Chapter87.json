It purports to say that the Quran being God’s last Message for mankind has been granted Divine protection against interference, distortion or interpolation. The promise of protection has been given in emphatic and clear terms, viz. “Verily, We Ourself have sent down the Reminder, and most surely We will be its Guardian” (15:10). The last fourteen centuries have witnessed the fulfilment of this mighty prophecy, in that the Quran has become a part of the thought and life of the Muslims as a whole, so much, that at all times there is found in the world a section of Muslims who proclaim and uphold its true teachings and learn its text by heart. The Quran that we have with us today is the same, without the change of a word or letter, which was given to the world by the Holy Prophet.</p><p>The Holy Prophet was human and as such he was apt to forget and he did forget things as far as the affairs of life were concerned. But God, in His infallible wisdom, had so arranged that despite the fact that the Prophet was not literate and sometimes long <i>Surahs</i> were revealed to him in one piece, the revelation remained so indelibly imprinted on his mind that he was never found to forget or falter in reciting the revealed portions. It is marvellous indeed that very long <i>Surahs</i> such as Al-Baqarah, Al-e-‘Imran or An-Nisa’, were revealed piecemeal, and a period of several years had intervened between the revelation of different parts of each of those <i>Surahs</i> and yet the Prophet never for a moment fumbled or faltered in putting the revealed verses in their proper places.</p>"
