According to some of the sayings of the Holy Prophet it is a certain river in Paradise, from which flow all other rivers. It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey and has its margin composed of pavilions of hallowed pearls (Lane, Aqrab, Mufradat and Jarir).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>The <i>Surah</i> refers to the Holy Prophet as one on whom abundant good has been bestowed. It was revealed at a time when the Prophet had nothing to give. He was living the life of a poor man and his claim to prophethood was looked upon with contempt and as unworthy of serious consideration. For years after the <i>Surah</i> had been revealed he was mocked and jeered at, opposed and persecuted and at last had to leave his native town as a fugitive, a price having been laid on his head. For several years at Medina, too, his life was in constant peril and Islam was eagerly expected (and humanly speaking justifiably) by its enemies to come to an early and tragic end. Then towards the end of his life an abundance of good in every shape and form began to pour down upon him like a cataract, and the promise contained in the <i>Surah</i> was literally fulfilled. The \"outlaw\" of Mecca became the arbiter of the destinies of the whole of Arabia, and the unlettered son of the desert proved to be the living Teacher of all mankind. God gave him a Book which is humanity’s infallible guide for all time to come. He imbibed and manifested in his person Divine attributes and rose to such high degree of nearness to his Creator as is possible for any human being to attain. He was blessed with a company of devoted followers whose loyalty and devotion has never been equalled, and when the call came to him from his Creator to leave the world he was satisfied that he had fully discharged the sacred task entrusted to him. In short, all kinds of good, material and moral, were bestowed upon the Holy Prophet in full measure. He, therefore, eminently deserved the title, \"the most successful of all Prophets\" (Enc. Brit.).</p><p>The word کوثر also signifies, a man possessing much good and one who gives much and often (Lane). The Holy Prophetwas given الکوثر in this sense also, because God raised among his followers a galaxy of Divinely inspired Reformers who successfully defended him and Islam in every age and guided and led the erring Muslims to the right path. Hadrat MirzaGhulam Ahmad, Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, was the most distinguished of these Reformers. He distributed most lavishly the treasures of divine wealth given to him by God, thus fulfilling the prophecy of the Holy Prophet about the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, viz. یفیض المال حتی لا یقبله أحد (Bukhari) i.e. he will spend spiritual wealth so lavishly that there will be none left to accept it. So the Promised Messiah may be الکوثر referred to in this verse.</p>"
