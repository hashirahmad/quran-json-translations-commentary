See also 15:29.</p><p>الفخار (baked pottery) is derived from فخر i.e. he boasted or recounted his glorious deeds or qualities, or he arrogated to himself greatness and nobility; he magnified himself by boasting. فخر (<i>fakhira</i>) means, he disdained or scorned. فخار means, baked pottery or baked vessels of clay, applied specially to empty vessels (Lane &amp; Aqrab).</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p><p>After having mentioned the creation of the celestial firmament and of the placing in it of the sun and the moon and of their regular and punctual movements, followed by a mention of the vegetables spreading of the earth and of all the that grow on it, the <i>Surah</i>, in the present verse proceeds to refer to the coming into existence of man, the climax, of all creation.</p><p>The creation of man from dry, ringing (صلصال) may signify that he has been created from matter in which the faculty and attribute of speech lay latent. As صلصال emits a sound only when struck with something extraneous, its use here is intended to hint that man’s power to respond is subject to his being able to receive the Divine Call.</p><p>Three words have been used in the Quran to express the different stages of the creation, and of the spiritual development of man. The first stage is expressed by the words خلقه من تراب i.e. God created him out of dust (3:60). The second stage is described by the expression خلقکم من طین i.e. He created you from clay (6:3), which means that after having received a sprinkling of Divine Word man attained the power of discrimination by which he could distinguish between right and wrong. At the third stage which is called the stage of فخار (baked pottery) man is tested and tried and is made to pass through the fire of trials and tribulations. So it is after he has successfully passed the tests and has attained spiritual maturity that he is received into Divine Presence.</p>"

The world had to wait for thirteen long centuries to see the fulfilment of this prophecy, in an age of new and great discoveries and inventions in the material world. It was in the fitness of time that, concurrently, equally great discoveries should have been made in the spiritual world, the fulfilment of the above prophecy being one of them. Or البحرین (the two bodies of water) may signify the physical and spiritual sciences. In this sense of the word the verses would mean that the two sciences—natural laws and Divine revelation, were mistakenly considered to be at logger heads, and a barrier seemed to have kept them apart, till, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, the great Divine Reformer of the age, the Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, succeeded in lifting that barrier and by his powerful writings unfolded the mighty truth that, instead of being antagonistic, these two sciences were corroborative of, and complementary to, each other, the one being the Work of God, and the other His Word. In this way the two seas were made to join each other.</p>"

Among other things the word means, \"that which is under the care of God\" or \"to which God directs His attention.\" In 28:89, we have کل شیء ھالک الا وجھه i.e. everything will perish except that which is under the care and protection of God or that by which His pleasure is sought.

It purports to say that since the earth is to be reduced to nothing and heavenly bodies all brought to nought and the whole material universe made non-existent, still human reason demands that there should be a being who should remain and who should never die nor be subject to change or decay. Such a Being is God Who created the whole universe and Who is the First and Final Cause of all things. The present and the previous verse point to two immutable laws of nature working simultaneously, viz. (1) everything is subject to decline, decadence and death, and (2) compliance with divine laws ensures continuity of life.</p>"

In the present and the following few verses we are told that pursuit of spiritual knowledge and higher moral values gives man perfect contentment and equanimity in this life and in the Hereafter.</p><p>The \"two Gardens\" referred to in the present verse may signify peace of mind which is the result of leading a good life and freedom from gnawing cares and anxieties which come in the wake of life spent in the pursuit of material pleasures and comforts. One Paradise consists in giving up one’s desires for the sake of God in this world and the other in being blessed with God’s pleasure in the next. A true believer perpetually basks in the sun of God’s grace in this life which cares cannot disturb. This is Paradise upon earth which is granted to a God-fearing man and in which he constantly dwells; the promised Heaven in the next world is only an image of the present Paradise, being an embodiment of the spiritual blessings which such a man enjoys in this life. It is to this paradisiacal state of a true believer that the two Quranic verses refer, viz. \"We are your friends in this life and in the Hereafter,\" (41:32) and \"for them are glad tidings in the present life and also in the Hereafter\" (10:65).</p><p>The \"two Gardens\" may also refer to the mighty Byzantine and Iranian Empires of which the conquest was promised to the Muslims. The Holy Prophet in a vision was given the keys of the palaces of the Emperors of Constantinople and Iran. The vision was literally fulfilled during the Caliphate of ‘Umar when these countries were conquered by Muslim armies. The fact that in a hadith, Saihan and Jaihan, the two rivers of Iran; and Furat (the Euphrates) and Nil (the Nile) have been spoken of as the rivers of Paradise (Muslim), lends powerful support to the view that the \"Gardens\" spoken of in the verse were the fertile valleys watered by these two sets, each of two rivers.</p>"

This is to emphasize that apart from the great blessings and boons of Paradise in the next world, true believers will have all the good things of this world also. The <i>Surah</i> was revealed early at Mecca when only a few persons had accepted Islam and even those few were very poor and without worldly means and were being harried and harassed and most of them had to take refuge in Abyssinia from the bitter persecution of the Quraish. It was then that the promise was made to them that one day they would recline on couches placed on rich carpets. This Divine promise was literally fulfilled in the lifetime of the very Muslims who, while at Mecca, did not know where to lay their heads.</p><p>The \"inner linings being of thick brocade\" implies a beautiful hint that the inner-self of a believer is purer and more beautiful than his outer-self.</p>"

And there can be no better companion for a person than a beautiful and virtuous wife. The Quranic Paradise is not conclusively reserved for righteous men. Righteous women will be equally entitled to it.</p><p>It will be noticed that purity of heart of the companions of believers is given precedence over the beauty of their persons referred to in v.59. The expression قاصرات الطرف signifies that their whole attention would be devoted to God and they would not even cast a look at any other thing beside their Lord and Creator, and far from their bodies being touched by any man, even impure thoughts will not find access to their hearts, the word جن also signifying those invisible things that excite carnal passions in the mind. It is relevant to state here again that according to Islamic conception the blessings of Paradise would resemble the pleasures of the life on earth. There will be palaces, gardens, rivers, trees, fruits, wives, children, friends, etc., only the nature of these things would be different from that of the things of this world. They would be so highly spiritual that the human mind cannot conceive of them. But their existence cannot be denied. See also 32:18 &amp; 52:21.</p><p>Incidentally, the verse repudiates the false idea that women will not go to Paradise.</p>"

But the description of the \"two Gardens\" mentioned in v.47 being different from that in the present verse shows that two categories of believers have been mentioned in this <i>Surah</i>; the believers to whom \"Gardens\" mentioned in v.47 have been promised seem to be of a higher spiritual status than those to whom \"Gardens\" mentioned in the verse under comment have been promised.

In v. 51 fountains promised to believers have been described as flowing freely and ceaselessly while in the present verse these springs are described as gushing forth with water. This signifies that believers to whom springs mentioned in v. 51 have been promised are of a higher spiritual status than believers to whom springs mentioned in the present verse have been promised; since believers of former category are engaged in doing good to others ceaselessly and freely without any idea or expectation of reward while those of the latter class do good works out of natural impulse but the doing of good is mainly confined to themselves.</p>"

It is both singular and plural and the feminine is عبقریة. They say ثیاب عبقریة i.e. clothes or garments of admirable manufacture, so called in relation to a certain town عبقر in Yemen in which clothes or garments and carpets are figured and variegated and are of the utmost beauty. Thus عبقری means, a kind of carpet variously dyed and figured; perfect or complete applied to anything; a lord or chief of men; one who has none above him and is strong. ھذا عبقری قومmeans, this is a chief or Lord of a people. The word is also applied as an epithet denoting superlativeness of any quality. ظلمعبقری means, an excessive tyranny. The Holy Prophet is reported to have related a dream, mentioning ‘Umar and said: فلم أر عبقریا یفری فریه i.e. I have not seen a chief of a people do his wonderful deed. عبقری حسان means, beautiful variegated carpets (Lane &amp; Aqrab).</p><p>Again the words used in v. 55 about believers show that they possess a greater dignity, respect and authority than those to whom the present verse refers. With this verse the comparison between the two categories of believers specifically mentioned in the next <i>Surah,</i> i.e. \"the foremost\" (56:11) and \"those on the right hand\" (56:28) comes to an end.</p>"
