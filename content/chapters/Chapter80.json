As the Holy Prophet was engaged one day in a talk with some of the Quraish Chiefs about some matters of belief, there came up ‘Abdullah bin Ummi Maktum and, thinking that the Holy Prophet’s precious time and energy were being wasted on the confirmed leaders of disbelief, he sought to divert his attention and asked to be enlightened on some religious questions. The Holy Prophet disliked the intrusion, and showed his displeasure by turning aside from ‘Abdullah (Tabari and Bayan). The incident, while it showed the Holy Prophet’s solicitude for the spiritual well-being of the Quraish leaders, in that he continued his discourse with them and paid no heed to ‘Abdullah’s interruption was evidence of his great regard for the tender susceptibilities of the poor blind man, inasmuch as the Prophet merely turned his face from ‘Abdullah, an act which the latter could not see, not saying even a word of reproach or disapprobation to him for his inopportune and rash interruption. The verse thus throws a flood of light on the moral stature of the Holy Prophet; and instead of implying a reproach or rebuke, as some commentators seem to think, enjoins him and, through him, his followers, to have due regard for the tender susceptibilities of the poor, the humble, and the downtrodden.</p><p>The words \"he frowned and turned aside,\" according to most commentators of the Quran refer to the Holy Prophet, but more correctly they seem to refer to the arrogant attitude of the conceited Quraish leader with whom the Holy Prophet was engaged in conversation and who turned away his face disdainfully, thinking how a humble and lowly person could dare interfere in the talk he was having with the Prophet.</p>"

But the verse under comment may be applied more fittingly to those critics who would find fault with the Holy Prophet’s attitude towards ‘Abdullah bin Ummi Maktum on that particular occasion but who themselves, in their conceit and pride, would behave arrogantly towards the poor and the lowly. Thus these verses have been used ironically; they bring home to the critics their own state of mind; and do not refer to any weakness of the Holy Prophet. The next verse also supports this interpretation.</p>"

Such will be the condition of disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection. The advent of the Holy Prophet has also been likened to \"Resurrection\" in the Quran, as also the advent of every great Divine Reformer. With the advent of a Divine Messenger a wide gulf intervenes between believers and disbelievers, however closely related they may be. It is to this unpalatable truth that Jesus referred when he said:</p><p>I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, young wife against her mother-in-law. (Matt. 10:35).</p>"
