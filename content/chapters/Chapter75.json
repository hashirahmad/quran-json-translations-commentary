In moments of weakness of the flesh, in this stage, he may falter or fall, but will not perish, every failure bringing with it a fresh reproach and repentance. The human in man gets the upper hand in him. It is the beginning of his spiritual resurrection. النفس اللوامةhas been cited here in evidence of the Final Resurrection. If man has no responsibility, if he has not to account for his deeds in an afterlife, why this pricking of conscience at the doing of an evil deed?</p><p>The highest stage of development of the human soul, however, is that of النفس المطمئنة i.e. the spirit at rest.

In fact, the word بنان represents man’s power and strength, as by means of his hand he grasps an object and defends himself. In fact man’s hands, i.e. his fingers, are the most important members of his body. The word بنان as given under Important Words may stand for the whole human body.

Or the reference may be to the lunar and solar eclipses—a highly unusual phenomenon, which, according to a hadith was to occur in the time of the Promised Mahdi. The hadith is to the following effect: ان لمھدینا اٰیتین لم تکونا منذ خلق السموات و الارض الخ i.e. For our Mahdi there are two signs which have never been witnessed since the time when the heavens and the earth were created, viz. that the moon will be eclipsed on the first night and the sun on the second day in the month of Ramadan(Baihaqi). This meant that the day of the final triumph of Islam and that of the defeat and destruction of the forces of evil will dawn with the Mahdi’s appearance in the world. Strangely enough, both the sun and the moon were eclipsed in the month of Ramadan in 1894 after Ahmad, the Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement had made the claim that he was the Promised Messiah and Mahdi.</p>"

It is this practice that the Prophet was enjoined in this verse to give up, because, as stated in the following three verses, God had taken upon Himself not only to safeguard the text of the Quran from being tampered with but also to see that it was collected in the form of an immaculately arranged Book (see General Introduction) and that its Message was conveyed and explained to the whole world (15:10). Or the meaning may be that, because the preceding verses referred to a day of reckoning for disbelievers, the Holy Prophet was naturally anxious that the revelation bearing upon the promised punishment should come soon. He is here told that he need have no anxiety on that score, as it was God’s own responsibility, when a revelation should descend and what form the punishment should take, and that the Quran should be collected, read and explained to the world. It may be convenient to set out here three quotations: \"There is otherwise every security, internal and external, that we possess the text (of the Quran) which Muhammad himself gave forth and used\" (Muir). \"Efforts of European scholars to prove the existence of later interpolations in the Quran have failed\" (Enc. Brit.). \"The Quran is perhaps the most read book in the world. Certainly it is the most often memorized, and possibly it exerts the greatest influence on those who read it\" (The Religions of Man).</p><p>Besides the meaning given in the text, the verse has also been interpreted as follows: \"It is Our responsibility that We should explain the Quranic revelation through your tongue\" (Ruhul-Ma‘ani). This speaks volumes for the inviolability of the Holy Prophet’s <i>Sunnah</i> and its indispensability as a safe and sure guide, next only to the Quran itself. For a detailed exposition, however, of this and the preceding verse see General Introduction and 15:10.</p>"
