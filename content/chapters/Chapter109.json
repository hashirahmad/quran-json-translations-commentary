Some say that as the pagan Meccans had put their question in two forms, therefore two forms have been adopted in answer to their question. Others say that the repetition is for the sake of emphasis. Yet some others like Zajjaj are of the opinion that the first two sentences signify denial of worship in the present time and the last two sentences denial of it in future. As against this, Zamakhshari says that the first two sentences stand for denial of worship in future while the last two for that in the past. Be that as it may, when لا (no, not) governs مضارع, it signifies future tense. According to this usage of the particle the expression would mean: \"I will never worship.\"</p><p>Moreover, the particle ما is used in two ways; as مصدریه transforming into infinitive the verb which it governs, and as موصوله meaning الذی i.e. \"that which.\" Sometimes it is also used for rational beings and means من i.e. \"he who.\" According to the various uses of the particle the verses would mean: I will not adopt your way of worship, or, I will not worship those that you worship, whether rational beings or irrational inanimate things. But the verses have a better and more appropriate translation if ما is taken as مصدریه in the former two verses and as موصوله in the latter two. Thus, the four verses would be interpreted something like this \"I will never adopt your mode or manner of worship, nor will you adopt the manner in which I worship. And I shall not worship those things (idols) or rational or irrational beings whom you worship, nor will you worship Him Whom I worship.\"</p>"
